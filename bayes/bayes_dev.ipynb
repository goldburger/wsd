At noon , another is made ; and on we go , running some of the rapids , letting down with lines past others , and making two short portages .He was investigating a routine complaint , he said , but we were in the clear as far as he was concerned ; Jack was a fine healthy donkey . He asked about exercise , and we showed him the exercise line .It was true that there were no spikes in papyrus boats . Instead , a block of wood was made fast with rope on top of the reed bundles , and the mast was stepped into it and secured with lines .Who ever would have guessed , when they made fast to the shore , that in ten minutes the diving suit would be called for in such a frantic hurry ? The air pump whispered steadily in his ear as he trailed pipe and lines behind him .On certain days the waves weren\\'t big enough to make much difference , but at other times they were mountainous , and he would arrive home soaked to the skin and aching in every muscle . But he loved it , and he never got over the thrill of feeling the sudden tug when a fish hit his line .However , let it be understood that no one should dive without some type of personal float , such as an inflatable vest , in addition to a surface float . A good automobile inner tube with attached line makes a very effective and practical surface float for resting .Held in this way , the men are able to pull her into a cove , in the left wall , where she is made fast . But this leaves a man on the rock above , holding to the line of the little boat .They were soon becalmed and were waiting for help when a fishing boat appeared . Without a word the skipper threw the girls a line and began to tow them to shore .Sheer chance has led him east . He passes by the trailing lines of fishermen from Neah Bay and Sekiu and Pysht .To us who are below , it seems impossible to keep the boat from going under the overhanging cliff ; but Powell , for the moment , heedless of Bradley\\'s mishap , pulls with all his power for half a dozen strokes , when the danger is past ; then he seizes Bradley , and pulls him in . The men in the boat above , seeing this , land , and she is let down by lines .The combatants glaze their kite lines with a mixture of paste and ground glass , then take their positions with highly maneuverable kites . Lines cross , overlap .The company argued that its foreman needn\\'t have told the worker not to move the plank to which his lifeline was tied because \"that comes with common sense.\" The commission noted, however, that Dellovade hadn\\'t instructed its employees on how to secure their lifelines and didn\\'t heed a federal inspector\\'s earlier suggestion that the company install special safety lines inside the A-frame structure it was building.Top loading automatic washer with essential cycle and temperature controls , soap or detergent , bleach , water softener , starch , laundry .

From other parts of the ship , other heaving lines had been thrown , other messengers passed , now that the two ships were riding together more or less comfortably harnessed together with the heavy Manila .I\\'d seen it work once on a large hunting dog . With assorted children in attendance , I led the donkey to the line . Then Chris , who was ten , snapped the catch onto the exercise line .A bucket at his side was overflowing with pollack . He hauled the line in , baited it carefully with a piece of bacon , and lobbed it back into the sea with a splash . Hold the rod ,  Freddy repeated grimly ; he began sawing on the line with his penknife ; the shark was twisting at the end , swinging back and forth like a pendulum . As Freddy slashed through the line , Lynn and George toppled over backward , and the shark , as amazed as any of them , dropped with a towering splash into the piranha tank . Maybe you\\'ve caught a whale !  The shining line came up out of the water . Help me play it , you fool . It\\'ll break the line .\\nphone\\tBut with the city\\'s growth as the West Coast\\'s financial hub and the gateway to the Pacific Rim, businessmen with expense accounts have clamored for first-class hotel rooms.

On Parker Street the buildings seemed to be dwellings , to judge from the lines of wash near them .He was wet and hungry and weary but the Fleet oiler was moving up alongside the carrier , and the warrant bosun had to leave off swearing . Those messenger lines had to be passed , and he could save five minutes if he made quite sure that they went over at the first attempt .Modern echo sounders are so sensitive they can detect shipwrecks and schools of fish . The equipment replaces the older technique of throwing a weighted line into the sea .Then we go , gliding by hills and ledges , with distant walls in view ; sweeping past sharp angles of rock ; stopping at a few points to examine rapids , which we find can be run , until we have made another five miles , when we land for dinner .

Unless they had stout anchor lines and plenty of scope , they would be in trouble .The Professor imagined that he was far above them , so that he could see men and their unknown ends as men can see longhorns and the ends they cannot see . He saw the remuda and the cowboys ; then he saw a wagon jolting along and himself holding drooping lines , sitting looking at the back ends of four mules .He cannot contain his excitement . He grabs a shark iron , a keen-edged harpoon with line and float attached , and seconds later hurls it deep into the back of a small female that slides beneath him .Your father was never fond of fishing , so he didn\\'t stock the lake .

When the wash was hung , Etsuko walked around between the lines .The application of pressure in matters of this kind requires a certain delicacy of touch and a measure of patience . It is like an angler who has only a light line to land a large fish .In a few minutes he , too , is kicking in the creel . I sit in happy meditation on my rock , pondering , while my line dries again , upon the ways of trout and men .The ship backs off with a clang of bells . A nylon line stretches taut to the whale , dripping along its length and trembling like a fiddle string .Then he was stopped abruptly a third time . The hunter gave the line an angry jerk only to be pulled savagely backwards onto the seat of his sealskin pants .About three years ago, he nearly gave up because he had nothing to sell. Now his shelves are full, and towels and clothes hang from a line overhead. Doc ... Calling Doc ... Are you there on the fourth ? ... Calling Doc ...  No answer . I touched the wind-up button , the spool turned , and the fourth line came reeling in .That was enough distance in this thick air to walk out of sight of each other , as we soon discovered . These lines , not chain but light , tough rope , too strong to be broken , were all one needed to be sure he would not float off in space when he stepped or jumped .There is nothing like the used clothing bazaar in Kabul on a windy November day . Etched against the bleak , drab sky are sweaters , suits , and long underwear that dance merrily in the breeze on myriad lines high above your head .Once or twice I thought the first drops had begun to fall . I rushed downstairs to bring the washing in from the line .Now and then Ra heeled so violently that everyone gripped the stays and hung outboard as a counterweight . The duck was washed overboard on its line time after time , and in the worst of the chaos it broke a leg , which Yuri later had to set .Later I spoke to Georges , pointing out that on this voyage no one was obliged to clean up after anyone else . Shortly afterward Georges\\' fishing tackle , tape recorder and dirty clothes had been picked off the deck and cabin roof , and he and Carlo began hauling on the same line together .Not only that , but the midget sub was about to pull the motor launch down , too . \" Cut the line ! \"Will he be first ? Will the line foul his propellers or break his rudder ?Give it a prolonged blow. Proudly, I give the green line a tug.A few seasons ago, he fell into the water wrestling with a large catch. He hung on to his line -- and landed the fish.Their task of keeping the bow into the seas had been eased by the sea anchor , but they must still be alert for every plunging movement of the ship . Merewether took a turn of line about himself and fastened it to the weather shrouds . There\\'s none there .  He hurried outside to see if there were any dry ones on the line .If you see blue sky through more than one panel , pull your reserve ... . Start preparing your landing immediately . Watch for smoke or flags to see how the wind is blowing on the ground ... . Put your arms up on the shroud lines and grab a handful .Trigano grasped it and tied it securely around his bundles . Then he tugged twice on the line .The Yard Families fortunate enough to have yard space are no doubt already using it for soft ball , pitching practice , touch football , and the like . Badminton is a great family game , and a clothes line may be used for a net in a pinch .All animal life was new and full of wonder for Jim as much as for Chet , and he longed to see a fish , to touch its scaly sides , to examine its gills . But when ten minutes had passed without a nibble on Chet\\'s line , Jim started to give up hope .After more than three hours in the water , Brown was picked up . As he reached for the line thrown from the Warrington he was feebly shouting , \" I had eighteen men .The whale is no less astounded than the boy . The line speeds from the bucket like a living thing .On the deck of the Winslow , Ensign Worth Bagley stood ready to catch it . Before the line could be cast , a shell struck the Winslow , instantly killing Bagley and three torpedo men . Despite the enemy fire , which now seemed to be entirely concentrated on the two struggling ships , the line was thrown . I mean it could have happened ! Just as he unfastened himself , he might have seen Doc coming along , with a hand on the line .\\nphone\\tInside a dark tent, Kayitan Kavas, a county commissioner, shouts into a telephone for more help. On the other end of the line, a voice promises 8,400 more blankets.\\ncordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcordcord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cordcord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord cord '"

       "\"In one , the `` Emma Dean `` is caught in a whirlpool , and set spinning about ; and it is with great difficulty we are able to get out of it , with the loss of an oar . At noon , another is made ; and on we go , running some of the rapids , letting down with lines past others , and making two short portages . He was investigating a routine complaint , he said , but we were in the clear as far as he was concerned ; Jack was a fine healthy donkey . He asked about exercise , and we showed him the exercise line . It was true that there were no spikes in papyrus boats . Instead , a block of wood was made fast with rope on top of the reed bundles , and the mast was stepped into it and secured with lines . Who ever would have guessed , when they made fast to the shore , that in ten minutes the diving suit would be called for in such a frantic hurry ? The air pump whispered steadily in his ear as he trailed pipe and lines behind him . On certain days the waves were n't big enough to make much difference , but at other times they were mountainous , and he would arrive home soaked to the skin and aching in every muscle . But he loved it , and he never got over the thrill of feeling the sudden tug when a fish hit his line . However , let it be understood that no one should dive without some type of personal float , such as an inflatable vest , in addition to a surface float . A good automobile inner tube with attached line makes a very effective and practical surface float for resting . Held in this way , the men are able to pull her into a cove , in the left wall , where she is made fast . But this leaves a man on the rock above , holding to the line of the little boat . They were soon becalmed and were waiting for help when a fishing boat appeared . Without a word the skipper threw the girls a line and began to tow them to shore . Sheer chance has led him east . He passes by the trailing lines of fishermen from Neah Bay and Sekiu and Pysht . To us who are below , it seems impossible to keep the boat from going under the overhanging cliff ; but Powell , for the moment , heedless of Bradley 's mishap , pulls with all his power for half a dozen strokes , when the danger is past ; then he seizes Bradley , and pulls him in . The men in the boat above , seeing this , land , and she is let down by lines . The combatants glaze their kite lines with a mixture of paste and ground glass , then take their positions with highly maneuverable kites . Lines cross , overlap . The company argued that its foreman need n't have told the worker not to move the plank to which his lifeline was tied because `` that comes with common sense . '' The commission noted , however , that Dellovade had n't instructed its employees on how to secure their lifelines and did n't heed a federal inspector 's earlier suggestion that the company install special safety lines inside the A-frame structure it was building . Top loading automatic washer with essential cycle and temperature controls , soap or detergent , bleach , water softener , starch , laundry . Discuss types of machine dryers , clothes lines , clothes pins , clothes pin bags , clothes line supports ; types of fabrics and colors , line space available , and weather conditions . Wet laundry in clothes basket , clothes line , clothes pins , clothes pin bag . When wash is dry , remove from line , article by article , placing pins in bag . But he is in a whirlpool . We have the stem-post of his boat attached to the line . There was a two-inch messenger line attached to the heaving line the warrant bosun was responsible for the vital knot which joined them and , by the time the two-inch line was being hauled into the battleship , the warrant bosun was ready to follow it with a 3-1/2-inch line , and that was followed by a five-inch line , and that was strong enough to have entrusted to it the immense Manila towline on which the rest of the operation depended . From other parts of the ship , other heaving lines had been thrown , other messengers passed , now that the two ships were riding together more or less comfortably harnessed together with the heavy Manila . I 'd seen it work once on a large hunting dog . With assorted children in attendance , I led the donkey to the line . Then Chris , who was ten , snapped the catch onto the exercise line . A bucket at his side was overflowing with pollack . He hauled the line in , baited it carefully with a piece of bacon , and lobbed it back into the sea with a splash . Hold the rod , Freddy repeated grimly ; he began sawing on the line with his penknife ; the shark was twisting at the end , swinging back and forth like a pendulum . As Freddy slashed through the line , Lynn and George toppled over backward , and the shark , as amazed as any of them , dropped with a towering splash into the piranha tank . Maybe you 've caught a whale ! The shining line came up out of the water . Help me play it , you fool . It 'll break the line . phone But with the city 's growth as the West Coast 's financial hub and the gateway to the Pacific Rim , businessmen with expense accounts have clamored for first-class hotel rooms . Guests , who typically shell out $ 175 to $ 300 a night for a single ( the price can go up to $ 3,000 for the ne plus ultra in sybaritic surroundings ) , are being pampered with larger rooms or suites , real marble bathrooms with television , phones with more than one line , plush robes , exotic flowers and complimentary wine . phone Analysts said the two-year contract probably makes the Swedish telecommunications group the leading supplier of telecommunications equipment to China . Ericsson already has installed or taken orders for about 442,000 lines in China , and has a few smaller orders to supply switching equipment . phone The only reason the former employees reportedly gave for tapping the phones was for national security concerns . Three of the residents , whose lines were allegedly tapped , filed the suits . phone In Atlanta , John L. Clendenin , BellSouth 's chairman and chief executive , said the results reflect strong growth in both our telephone operating companies and our non-regulated subsidiaries .

I add my own non-expert suggestion Keep your eyes on the kite . The line may break ( mine has ) . He followed the fourth one out of sight . The last I saw he was running the line through his hand . division < p > @ The Federal Reserve Board 's decision to give three major bank holding companies limited authority to deal in securities through subsidiaries further blurs the legal line separating commercial and investment banking . product Stratus computers are used by many brokerage firms and stock exchanges to handle securities quotes and customer accounts data . Stratus said the new XA2000 line includes five systems with prices from $ 261,000 to $ 1.1 million . formation His deputy , William Ruckelshaus also refused , and Mr. Nixon fired him . Then Mr. Nixon turned to the person who was third in line , Solicitor General Bork . cord Doc leaped . Doc , with not a ghost of a safety line attached to him , darted past us like a human rocket . phone In contrast , Pacific Telesis has won back many private-line and Centrex customers since it gained the right to reduce rates . California 's booming economy helped give Pacific Telesis the highest second-quarter growth in access lines among the Baby Bells . product IBM 's 80386 computers became available in June . Tandy introduced two additions to the low end of its line , aimed at two markets that are Tandy 's traditional strength , schools and home users . division Such foggy rhetoric reflects a 30-year-long weakening of the Democratic and Republican parties .

After adding Certus , a $ 189 anti-virus computer program , to its line of systems management software in early 1988 , Foundation Ware Inc. , Cleveland , has quadrupled sales every quarter , says founder Peter Tippett . What do you want me to do ? `` broke in Eugene eagerly , interrupting Vautrin . `` Almost nothing at all , `` rejoined he , allowing a movement of joy to escape him , inexorable as the expression of the angler who feels a fish at the end of his line . `` It 's all right , he said . On Parker Street the buildings seemed to be dwellings , to judge from the lines of wash near them . He was wet and hungry and weary but the Fleet oiler was moving up alongside the carrier , and the warrant bosun had to leave off swearing . Those messenger lines had to be passed , and he could save five minutes if he made quite sure that they went over at the first attempt . Modern echo sounders are so sensitive they can detect shipwrecks and schools of fish . The equipment replaces the older technique of throwing a weighted line into the sea . Then we go , gliding by hills and ledges , with distant walls in view ; sweeping past sharp angles of rock ; stopping at a few points to examine rapids , which we find can be run , until we have made another five miles , when we land for dinner . Then we let down with lines , over a long rapid , and start again . The Saratoga came next , followed by the Ticonderoga and the Preble . Mobility had been provided for by attaching spring lines to the anchor cables , one on each side the ships could be moved in position by hauling in on one line , while paying out on the other . The kedge went down nearly a mile from the ship . Men fell to on the capstan , winding in the line . phone A spokesman for the NSA declined to comment on the agency 's role in the Iran-Contra affair . Intelligence sources said the encryption devices , described as computer-type keyboards that are connected to ordinary telephone lines , are n't the most sophisticated such machines developed by the NSA . product Earnings for the quarter were on target , analysts said . All segments of their business were up in sales , and they had an especially strong gain in their prescription line , '' said PaineWebber 's Mr. Nordmann . Looking down , Jeremy saw the water turning pink below his neck . As the throbbing pain in his temple increased , he knew it was too far to shore and too far to reach for a handhold on one of the boats ' anchor lines . Thus taken between the two vessels , U-415 began her slow march into port . 0445 Maneuvering with difficulty on our one lame diesel , I aimed my ship toward the illuminated square in the bunker , where I saw a few black figures waiting on the pier . The bow bounced off the concrete head wall , but the lines , already fastened at the pillars on land , held the boat steady . With cat-like care not to roil his majesty 's bath , I step in , and stand stock-still for five minutes to let things calm down . The while , I strip out , oil , dry , and coil upon my left hand thirty feet of line . The singletree on the off side dragged and bounced against the front wheel . The lines in the Professor 's hands drooped down onto the tongue and neck yoke . She waited while her host removed a dismantled speaker assembly on his single upholstered chair and flicked the cushion in a grand manner with his pocket handkerchief . She took the hand he offered to aid her cakewalk to the chair over the coiled lines . Ready now ! Coil up the dry line and stand midstream , rod in instant readiness . But it was a little longer than that , though at last they were there a farm and its farmyard , lightless . The stranger stopped the horse and handed Picklock the lines . product A good example is its July purchase of Cessna Fluid Power division from General Dynamics Corp . The unit , with annual sales of about $ 100 million , fills out Eaton 's hydraulics products line and provides an entry into Europe 's hydraulics business . product Upriver , men demonstrate the business end of a blowgun .

The engines in both those lines are 1.6 liter . cord A second aquanaut , pretending to be lost , would then signal the porpoise by turning on his own buzzer . After Tuffy reached the victim , `` the aquanaut would remove the line from Tuffy 's harness and use it as his guide back to the habitat . Even so , the sheer clutter in that basement took a bit of sorting out , especially in that dim light . One wall had a floor-to-ceiling spread of wall-bars on gymnasium lines . Without the shelter of the small boat harbor , they were pitifully vulnerable to the gale that drove into the bay from the open sea . Unless they had stout anchor lines and plenty of scope , they would be in trouble . The Professor imagined that he was far above them , so that he could see men and their unknown ends as men can see longhorns and the ends they can not see . He saw the remuda and the cowboys ; then he saw a wagon jolting along and himself holding drooping lines , sitting looking at the back ends of four mules . He can not contain his excitement . He grabs a shark iron , a keen-edged harpoon with line and float attached , and seconds later hurls it deep into the back of a small female that slides beneath him . Your father was never fond of fishing , so he did n't stock the lake . When I was a youngster I was used to waste hours hopefully casting a line on to it , until my uncle gently broke it to me that there were no trout in it . We could hear voices and shouted orders . At length , a signal was given and men started pulling on the line which ran through the block at the peak of the tripod . Early on the third day after our encounter with the British cruisers , we found the lonely Belchen at the designated place . Approaching slowly , we identified ourselves , exchanged courtesies through the megaphone , and caught the line to which the oil hose was fastened . As he came alongside , a hatchway opened in the side of the ship above him . A line was played down to the rowboat . The lifeless body rolls in a pink wash . They haul her partly out of the sea with the ship 's tackle and a line looped round her flukes . The two men hauled on the fish .

George cried , and pulled on the lines so hard that he sat down almost on top of his father 's head . Fastened securely to the pin is a barbless hook similar to a fisherman 's gaff . Throwing the pin-like float , with rawhide line attached , over and beyond the dead animal , the hunter drags it back across his prize , snagging it with the sharp hook . In March it is wise to clean cupboards , and cabinets . The closets need a good airing and all the clothes need to be hung on the line in the backyard . Now , if someone was to cut the arm of that hoist almost through , then the first time Doc got a good heavy dredge-load outa the water the arm 'd most likely break , and the whole thing 'd go straight to the bottom . Might even take Doc with it , if he got fouled up in the line . They can , however , be summed up simply Never think of your limits or distant goals ; keep telling yourself to go just a little farther . If the Daedalus pilot does run out of steam , though , he can toss a line to a chase boat , which in theory will be able to keep the aircraft aloft by pulling it to shore like a giant kite . The one Lynn had hooked measured about two feet in length ; George saw that they could never get it up even if they had wanted to . `` Hold the rod , `` Freddy repeated grimly ; he began sawing on the line with his penknife ; the shark was twisting at the end , swinging back and forth like a pendulum . It is with no little misgiving that we see the river enter these black , hard walls . At its very entrance we have to make a portage ; then we have to let down with lines past some ugly rocks . Both full stop . Fasten all lines . Soon a detachment of sailors gathered at the base of the lighthouse to work out a way to get Thompson down . Homemade kites with lines attached were flown up in the air . For tedious seconds nothing happened . Then there was a series of sharp bangs as some of the tow lines parted . It might even be expressed more forcibly still The admiral at the battleship 's bridge , the admiral with the broad gold on his sleeve , irascibly signalling `` Expedite , `` was at that particular moment a less important person than the warrant bosun , wet through , worn out , and yet still swinging out the boom and hose with all the accurate judgement of twenty years of experience . The work had begun before daylight ; and night was about to fall when the last line was cast off and faked down . We spend the whole day on the water . Pascal fishes with a line that has a number of hooks on it . The eldest boy had got over his seasickness , and he and the middle one sat in numbed silence in the stern . When they reached the dock , Bubba made the lines fast and then helped the woman out of the boat . I blow upon my fly to give it one last fluff , lay it on the stream at my feet , and quickly pay out coil after coil . Then , just as the line straightens out and the fly is sucked into the jungle , I walk quickly downstream , straining my eyes into the dark vault to follow its fortunes . How satisfying it was to be expected , how good it was to have survived ! A military band launched into a resounding march as U-557 came alongside the quay and fastened her lines . The tank Lynn was referring to was in the deepest of the shadows , but they could all make out several shapes moving to and fro in the turgid waters . One more it is , `` agreed Sally , and she turned the line over to Lynn . Some families rig old automobile batteries to an underwater light . The fish , attracted by the light , bite the pieces of raw shrimp bait on the hooks dangling from the lines of the fishing poles . May 31 . We start down another canyon , and reach rapids made dangerous by high rocks lying in the channel ; so we run ashore , and let our boats down with lines . Ranging too far from an underwater habitat can be dangerous because the diver may not be able to find his way back . To prevent any such incident during the Sealab experiment the aquanauts were attached to their dwelling by guide lines whenever they swam for any distance . Mr. Coate was on the water but a few minutes when he said , `` Here they are . . . let 's catch some of 'em . '' Lines were lowered and soon one of the rods sprang to life , and a shiny bronze walleye was swung on board . My wrists and arms ached intolerably , and though I had eaten heartily of a twelve o'clock lunch , I had worked so hard that I was faint from hunger . I pulled in the oars and bent forward to the line which held the tow . Meanwhile , the Fairy moves in under full power and two sailors carry rifles up to the peak . They blaze away at the running whale for an hour and are about to quit from exhaustion when they see the line go slack . Come here and give me a hand . `` While the two detectives were chatting , the skipper on his own initiative had baited a line and apparently hooked a massive fish . Many hands grabbed the line from the panting cook . His palms were slashed and bleeding where the line had burned deep furrows in them . We passed some crumbling houses on the left . The clothes on the line were flying in the wind . But if anything happened to you , they could use you for seed . `` The Soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly together , also lashing them to the body of the Saw-Horse ; so there seemed little danger of their tumbling off . `` The only sound was a wailing baby somewhere in the boat . Lines were dropped , and now the boat was fast . When she was not helping her mother make bread , or sliding pots of bubbling brown beans in or out of the big oven at the side , or basting great joints of meat , she was on her knees scrubbing the wooden floors , their planks worn smooth by the steady tattoo of many feet and by sanding and scouring . Or she was washing the big tubful of clothes that accumulated so quickly , hanging them out to dry on a line that reached all the way across the clearing behind the house . Each child crayons a design on his or hers , after he has printed his name in big letters . The cardboards are stapled to a long , strong line , which then can be looped around the room , or between posts or trees , or along a fence . When Albert Cluveau said that about Ned my heart started beating so fast I thought I might fall . I held on tight to the fishing pole till I was steady , then I pulled in my line and went back home . I well remember a particular incident I came upon the two older boys fishing in the late evening at the side of the pond . Two grown men were rigged like wireless stations with every imaginable kind of fish line and fish lure , having fun for themselves . The men were to swim down to the hole in the hull and push the corks through it so they would bob to the surface inside the ship . There , other men would grasp the lines attached to the corks . We looked more like undernourished and fatigued jungle fighters . Our lines were thrown ashore . No one had the heart to kill it , however , so it was spared and christened Sinbad . With a line tied to its foot , it became master of the foredeck , while Safi kept to the cabin area . He was playing his own game of hide-and-seek , enjoying the protective coloration of his space suit . Dillo touched one of the buttons at the platform , and the spool for the fourth hitch reeled in the line slowly . Well , no , Sam , Alice said kindly , `` it is really time for us to go anyway . Perhaps next time we come , you will put a fence round the washing line . Then Pete heard Ron 's voice . He pulled in his line and put his pole between the rocks where the wind could n't reach it . Flag-line fishermen cruise offshore , putting out lines that are from five to eight miles long . These long lines are set at intervals with baited hooks marked by floats and buoys . Jim ran to his father , who was studying the ice near the edge of the water , and called , `` Ted 's got London on the radio , Dad ! `` They gathered around all but Chet , who went on dangling his line stolidly as though the entire success of their journey depended on his luck as a fisherman . They haul on the line to bring the boat in , but the power of the current , striking obliquely against her , shoots her out into the middle of the river . The men have their hands burned with the friction of the passing line ; the boat breaks away , and speeds , with great velocity , down the stream . We can climb it , and walk along its summit to a point where we are just at the head of the fall . Here the basalt is broken down again , so it seems to us , and I direct the men to take a line to the top of the cliff , and let the boats down along the wall . One man remains in the boat , to keep her clear of the rocks , and prevent her line from being caught on the projecting angles . Mrs. Smith was standing looking out of the windows , which opened on the water . In the distance a pair of white sailboats were skimming along on the breeze , and closer at hand a water skier was weaving in an intricate pattern at the end of a line attached to a motorboat . It was a mackerel , about 12 inches long . I threw my line out and landed a small sea bass . A wide stream up which launches and small ships moved back and forth ? Where people on this hot Saturday morning would be drifting idly in little boats , trailing lines in the water , fishing the sandy bottom ? There are grown macho men who can skin game but who wo n't touch an eelpout , says Jeffrey Gunderson , a representative of the University of Minnesota 's Sea Grant Extension program , which tries to promote underused fish . `` They 'll cut their lines rather than bring it into the boat and unhook it . '' We 'll bring the Bristol in , he called , indicating a motorboat swaying on its moorings . Dick waved that he understood , then lowered his water skis to the sand and started to uncoil a tangled line , tossing an end to Alan Carlisle . Behind our house in the laundry , Mary and Tessie spent their Mondays on two sides of a big ironing table , passing over the sheets an iron heated by a little coal stove . Outside the laundry in a small mosquitoey backyard , bathing suits hung eternally on the line ; there was a big coal bin by the fence . As the two Hindus took in the sail , the old man used the last of the boat 's way to lay alongside the starboard gangway . Jackson , boatswain 's mate of the watch , took a line , and shouted for side boys . A thin and broad-shouldered young man named Pylor , from the island of Kea , said that he had much diving experience after the sponges that grew offshore there , and he volunteered to look under the galley . A line was tied under his arms and he dived and came up quite soon after . He introduced his children to the sport as toddlers , and was n't about to take no for an answer . When Camille balked at taking the line at age four , she was left to ponder her choice in the middle of a lake . Kuktoy had lived on the island all of his life and had weathered more trials than I 'd ever heard about . As a young man , Kuktoy had three of his fingers ripped out of their sockets by getting them fouled in a rawhide harpoon line and had doctored them himself . Saturday morning she ran the sweeper and in the afternoon she bought groceries . Monday after work she washed the navy blue and white Orlon dress she wore Sunday to the movies and hung it on the rope line above the bathtub . The strain had been too great . Somewhere along the line the strands were parting , and at any minute the cable might snap completely . Any hungry shark following will come after the fish , not the diver . The length of the line protects a diver by giving him time to see an approaching shark and swim away . Dillo was shouting . `` Who let the chimp off the line ? `` When he pulled up the hook , it was picked clean . He stood watching it swing slowly back and forth on the end of his line . I found a light kedge anchor in the fore hold , where such things were kept , and with a deal of exertion got it on deck and into the boat . With a long running line coiled down in the stern , I rowed well out into our little cove and dropped the anchor into the water . So the men made their own . Men forged hooks and filched nylon lines from aerial kites and weather balloons . Sally , Freddy , Lynn , and George scrambled back across the branch , down to the earth , and out of the museum grounds as fast as they could . `` I hope the line disappears in the fight , `` Freddy said as he replaced the ladder in the little equipment shed from which he had borrowed it . He stood a few yards away , to one side of the entrance . Then he jerked the line , suddenly , and clasped his hands over his ears . Tall mulatto in the white cowboy hat said ' Nough of this . Langlois , fetch two plow lines off that wagon . `` Sappho said he was running before the tall mulatto mentioned the plow lines , he just started running faster when he heard it . At the best of the local hotels , the door was already locked at 7:30 in the evening . After several rings , the proprietor reluctantly showed his guest to a rooftop cell with concrete walls and floor , a pile of flea-ridden mattresses , no sheets , two naked bulbs , and a laundry line strung with damp clothes . The crew strolled aboard in small groups , as inconspicuously as possible , so as not to suggest to the French dockhands of the night shift that we might be sailing . At midnight we removed the lines from the pillars . Catch anything ? the leader asked . `` Just one , `` Drew answered , pointing to the fish he had tied up on a line floating in the water . You came here to fish , said Galkin . `` Put your line in the water , then sit down and tell me all about yourself . `` Pass it forward , get it under the bows and astern . `` Men struggled to position the heavy line ; once more the capstan clanked its turns . The boom leans perilously over the side ; the deck slants ; a bucket bangs against the rail . Now a man jerks a slender trip-wire following the line from deck to whale . Although these people live in Big Sky Country -- Montana , where a town can have a name that rings with heroic confidence , Great Falls , Sunburst , Victory -- they never achieve the baptism and resurrection that nature has so often promised characters in American fiction . They may fish and hunt a little , but they 're likely to feel sick about it , or bungle the job , or snag a dead deer that drowned in the river before they ever cast a line . He made him the gardener of the Kingdom , to drive away the sparrows from the King 's head . 48 . Old Hiram 's goat was feeling fine , ate three red shirts right off the line . Then we let down another boat to the end of its line beyond the first , and the third boat to the end of its line below the second , which brings it to the head of the fall , and under an overhanging rock . Then the upper boat , in obedience to a signal , lets go ; we pull in the line , and catch the nearest boat as it comes , and then the last . Jack Clements slowed the engine to make his dock approach . The change of pace brought the others up , and Emil came into the pilothouse while the two crewmen went to bow and stern , ready to make the lines fast to the dock . The set , designed by Mr. Hall 's longtime associate Eugene Lee , has the audience divided in half , facing a central playing area . Off to one side -- representing the `` have-nots '' of Louisiana -- is a broken-down shack with a woodpile and a wash line . The instant an aku hit a hook , he was jerked into the canoe and flipped off . At once , the line and hook were back in the water and the free hand of the fisherman stirring the surface again . To my horror , I realize I have pulled too hard . Down comes the green line as the great whistle blares forth , a shrill torrent of sound that wo n't stop . Get down now , Cluveau said . Ned handed Bam the lines . At such a place , we are letting down the last boat , and , as she is set free , a wave turns her broadside down the stream , with the stem , to which the line is attached , from shore , and a little up . They haul on the line to bring the boat in , but the power of the current , striking obliquely against her , shoots her out into the middle of the river . The new technology represents a considerable savings over conventional offshore production technology . The foundation of the project , a `` tension-leg well platform , '' will be a floating structure that is anchored to the seabed by steel mooring lines , a design that requires far less steel than conventional platforms do . They never went where they could not ride . Thinking of the days of waiting on the riverbank , I wished I had provided him with hooks and a line . Dillo shouted . Gary had already jumped in straight pursuit and jumping , he swung his arm and threw a wave into the slack of his line . June 22 . Still making short portages and letting down with lines . The museum raises the best catfish for eating in the world . `` Freddy quickly brought up six or seven catfish , and then Sally took over the line . It was up to him to ease the strain or take it up , keeping the ships at a constant distance apart without allowing the towline to break under the continual jerks to which the waves subjected it . If that line should part , everything else , including the precious hoses which the booms were beginning to swing out over the gap , would be torn asunder . From a plastic bag in the box she chose a few slices of fish which had been taken from their remaining stock . She baited the hooks and turned the line over to Freddy . Spreading full-length on the edge of the skylight , Freddy lowered the line into a likely-looking tank directly underneath the open pane . The King had no success and was just about to abandon his efforts when Nell with a sprightly laugh urged him `` But see , Sire , you have got a bite at last . `` Sure enough , when the King pulled in his rod , he found half a dozen fried smelts at the end of the line , tied to his hook with a silken thread . Yes , ma'am . I intend to , he said , almost insolently , backing toward the beds and uncoiling the line . `` Cleat up , the Captain ordered . A deckman fastened the tow line to a cleat in the middle of the boat . The chamber was off the bottom . Waves were now running some five feet , so the men hauling in on the line went with the motion of Falcon , letting out a little whenever she rose , pulling in as she dipped . Second to the aku fishery in the islands ' modern commercial fishing catch is the long-line or flag-line fishery . Flag-line fishermen cruise offshore , putting out lines that are from five to eight miles long . The Coast Guard was called about the dead dolphin . They came in a cutter and tied a line to its tail and began towing the body seaward . Did it fly ? Superbly with 200 rapt kite-fliers handling the lines . The red bra they 'd all seen , and several others that the men hoped to see again filled . At first the men tried to avoid being caught looking at the line . I stand on a projecting rock , waving my hat to gain his attention , for my voice is drowned by the roaring of the falls . Just at this moment , I see him take his knife from its sheath , and step forward to cut the line . We found the house really has a board floor under all that dirt . We washed all the bedding , and it 's hanging on the line right now . She fought like a professional , holding the rod inside the skylight , while George added his weight to her pull . Freddy reached through the opening and grasped the line . Tipped off that Mr. Willaby is `` noodling '' -- catching fish illegally by snagging them in the gills or flesh -- two wildlife officials follow the 250-pound fisherman out to Cedar Creek Lake here . They watch him dive under water with a fishing pole and a very short line and catch two flathead catfish , one 25 pounds and the other 30 pounds . We land at its mouth , and stop for an hour or two to examine the fall . It seems possible to let down with lines , at least a part of the way , from point to point , along the right-hand wall . And the neighbours seemed to be very nice . One had been hanging clothes on her line while they were in the backyard and they had got to talking , and she had invited them in for a cup of tea . But he was understood in spite of the impolite waves and two crewmen carefully hooked a resplendent chromium ladder to the gunwales . Needing no urging , Dennis let go his hold of the parachute lines at the same instant that he stretched out his arms to grab the tubular sidepieces . I 'll have the boats over to tow , if you please , the captain ordered . Boats dropped into the water , snaked out lines , and men bent to the oars . Later that night he scraped together as much debris as he could find in the cabin and tried to bury the untouched coon . Doc Painter had fastened a line to the water can and withdrew it the next morning , refilling it and slipping it back in again under the door . Neill felt his anger rising . The man was playing them , playing them like fish on a line . So , on this cool day in late March , I set to work . I engaged a cooperative clam digger for the use of his boat in helping me secure a line to the tail . The gunboat took its prize in tow , as the flagship signaled retirement for the small boats . The brigs and schooners advanced to get lines aboard their charges while the frigate , supporting with heavy fire , moved in toward the rocks through water that foamed with a hail of enemy projectiles . In this way , curious little alcoves are formed , in which are quiet bays of water , but on a much smaller scale than the great bays and buttresses of Marble Canyon . The river is still rapid , and we stop to let down with lines several times , but make greater progress as we run ten miles . Courtships in the night are also intriguing . The male web-weaver spider woos the female in her web with a series of tugs and tweaks on her lines . product In terms of speed , the new computers are expected to process from 2.7 million instructions per second , or MIPS , to more than 10 MIPS , depending on how many microprocessors are inside . In performance , they will overlap several IBM computers , including parts of the IBM 9370 line and the 4381 line . cord In June , Hornby disclosed it had a 5.1 % stake in Manitowoc and said it may seek control of the company . Manitowoc , a maker of cranes , power shovels , drag lines and other products , is based in Manitowoc , Wis. text Blacks talk to their stars on the screen . If they hear a clever line , they 'll say , 'Get down . ' Not too young , I 'd say . A new set of nappies suddenly appearing on the line would certainly set the neighbours chattering . Most divers in island waters carry a long line on which to string their catch . The end of this line is tied to an empty plastic bleach bottle , which serves as a buoy to keep the line floating so the diver can tow his catch a safe distance behind . There was no wind , the tide was high , and the schooner floated . Casting off the shore lines , I kedged her out by main strength , the windlass being broken , till she rode nearly up and down to the small anchor too small to hold her in any breeze . If he had n't it would n't have reached us , because it was a heavy coil with a long way to go . I snubbed the line around the wagon seat , and made it good and tight with several half hitches . George could see , dimly against the water , the shadows of several fish warily circling their unexpected midnight snack . In a short while there was a tug on the line . In forests , their goal is to drape their chutes over the crown of a tree and slide down through the limbs on let-down ropes . But `` You never really know for sure what 's waiting for you , '' says John Driscoll , a former smokejumper who once landed flat on his back on the Alaskan tundra after his chute lines twisted and his reserve parachute wrapped around his neck . ( Though he was n't hurt , `` I can still remember every second of it -- looking up to see the lines twisted and my parachute a worthless balloon over my head , '' he says . ) This is not government-dictated planning , Mr. Webber says . `` It 's using government as a productive partner -- a catalyst -- instead of a drag on the line . '' They used dog bones to make small hooks , pig bones for the medium size , and human bones for large fish hooks . Hawaiian fishermen jigged with lines fitted with a stone sinker bound to a cowrie-shell lure to catch octopus . Burke 's calculations were slightly off . He had to start the engines again to get his plane close enough to throw a line to the raft . Take a turn , he said quietly to the man . The boat puller obeyed , taking a turn around the little forward thwart and paying the line as it jerked taut . Hull considered the suggestion a moment . All right , Mr. Morris , have everything over five inches made up into a line , and send the launch and cutter ahead with a kedge anchor . The children are in a tree house high on the west hill . They have a perilously hung rope ladder which they tell me adults can not climb . ( And I believe them , for the ropes are the old lines from our ancient catboat . ) Hand over hand they pulled in the silk . Then as the chute billowed over the small deck , Dennis leaned overboard to gather in the last few feet of the lines . This afternoon , we find three falls in close succession . We carry our rations over the rocks , and let our boats shoot over the falls , checking and bringing them to land with lines in the eddies below . This time I 'm doing it myself , said Ace . He climbed over into the cutter and untied the line . Miss Eustis has a somewhat different version `` One man was drunk and had a bottle of brandy in his pocket , which the Quartermaster promptly threw overboard , and the drunken man was thrown into the bottom of the boat ... `` There was a different kind of trouble in Boat 6 . Friction erupted from the moment Major Peuchen slid down the line to fill out the crew . He could see the crumpled form lying on the deck , spray driving into him , in danger of being washed over the side . Merewether tried to loosen the line that secured him to the shrouds and make his way forward to give assistance . Foolishness . Doc must have taken Percussie 's line . One bush , with its brown stem laved in the middle current , shook with a perpetual silent laughter , as if to mock at any fly that gods or men might cast one inch beyond its outermost leaf . For the duration of a cigarette I sit on a rock midstream and watch my trout rise under his guardian bush , while my rod and line hang drying on the alders of the sunny bank . Kite battles are fought daily from roofs and fields in Asia . The combatants glaze their kite lines with a mixture of paste and ground glass , then take their positions with highly maneuverable kites . Of course , you ca n't keep an animal like that in a tiny pen all the time . He needed exercise , so we rigged up a line between two trees about 40 feet apart in the side yard . So he sells garlic . In one of his stalls in a back-alley market deep in Seoul 's south side he sells nothing but garlic Hundreds of straw `` chops '' or lines hang from the ceiling , each chop with 100 bulbs of garlic attached to it , each bulb containing five to 10 cloves . Furling the sail and lashing it securely about the mast , boom , sprit , and two pairs of spare oars , I threw it overboard . A line connected it with the bow , and as it floated low in the water , practically unexposed to the wind , it drifted less rapidly than the boat . Glassmaster Co. , Lexington , S.C. , started trading with the symbol GLMA . The company makes glass-fiber pleasure boats , monofilament lines and antennas . But things quickly became bleak again . We entered another dry period , and sharks carried away our lines before we could catch any more edible fish . The Saratoga moved again , completing her swing , inch by inch , with port guns firing as they bore . When it was observed aboard the Confiance that the American ship was swinging , a lieutenant had spring lines bent to his anchor cable in order to wind ship in similar fashion . The first step , after catching one , is to quickly turn the octopus inside out so that his sharp beaklike mouth has no chance to bite . Most divers in island waters carry a long line on which to string their catch . In an hour several dozen fish lay in the net on the bottom of the boat . `` That 's it , I think , `` the Professor said , reeling in his line . MANY LOBSTERS are alive and well and living in lost traps , say University of Maine researchers . During the past two years , the scientists have studied `` ghost lobster traps '' -- lost ones that sit on the ocean floor after lines to them are severed by storms , passing boats and other strains . Little knots of men swarmed over each boat , taking off the canvas covers , clearing the masts and useless paraphernalia , putting in lanterns and tins of biscuits . Other men stood at the davits , fitting in cranks and uncoiling the lines . I hoped they had n't come for dinner . It was going to be important for us to stay together , so I unwrapped the line from my waist , and we tied a length to each raft . But at the moment of contact Thomas Mugridge cried out . Then he came in like a fresh-caught fish on a line , clearing the rail generously and striking the deck in a heap , on hands and knees , and rolling over . But seriously folks , the Duvalls root heartily for each other on the water and are partners in a school for water-skiing-tournament aspirants in Windemere , Fla. Sammy wo n't try a tricks competition unless Camille is there to supervise his tow line . At all other times they carefully avoid our hens , even to the point as has been often the case of walking right through a cluster of them , looking as smugly self-righteous as you could imagine . At other times , both dog fox and vixen have walked slowly under the clothesline as clothes were being hung , and blown flapping , and the wheel of the line connected with a tree was squeaking loudly . With a wild scream he dived into the shark-filled waters . But his partner had enough strength to drag him back and then to grab Burke 's line . There is much scratching of heads Who knows how to shoot a whale ? How big a line we need to hold him ? The Negro had the line and it was hard to tell who was pulling what , when LePeters saw Boners march to the rear of the boat , yank out a pistol , and with perfect aim drill two shots through the fish 's head . `` What the fuck 'd you do that to the fish for ? `` said the skipper , holding a suddenly slack line . A two-pound bass on a fly-rod is more fun than a six-pounder on a bait-casting rod , said Mr. Kruger . `` Because the rod is so long and you hold the line directly in your fingers , you can feel every little fin vibration a bass makes . '' It was heard by ship brokers in Tokyo , and the stock of Matsushita broke half a point . Kasuo Fujima opens a roll of cloth in his kit and removes a length of cod line with triple hooks . I had held back the intestines to use for bait . Cherry weighted his line with a ring and dropped a hook overboard . All right , you red lobsters , avast there , he bellowed . `` Throw your captain a line and help haul me aboard . Maybe next year they could rope the hay off the rack . Jesse stood up and took the lines from George . The team stopped abruptly . He made a half-hitch with the lines at the top of the hayrack 's middle upright , and turned to take his fork . Finding I am caught here , suspended 400 feet above the river , into which I should fall if my footing fails , I call for help . The men come , and pass me a line , but I can not let go of the rock long enough to take hold of it . The stunts performed on the rope were the most interesting to me , however . The tightly stretched line served as a horizontal bar ; it had just enough spring to allow the contestants to combine their strength , nimbleness , and sense of timing into an astonishing array of acrobatic tricks . At the very moment when the man was apparently doomed to strike the hard edge of the apron and be dragged along its abrasive surface , the parachute tilted again , traded a share of downward motion for lateral slip , and drifted serenely over the grass . He struck and clutched at the lines while teetering , stumbled and rolled as the billowing canopy began to drag him heedlessly along the ground . It 's coming a little premonitory shiver in that aspen on the hill lets me get out half a cast , and swish it gently back and forth , ready for the main puff to hit the pool . No more than half a line , mind you ! Very good , said Galkin . He stood up and began reeling in his line . As she moved gracefully about on the glazed and frozen lawn , I realized that she was wearing ice skates ! I watched as she swooped down upon her clothes basket , extracted a piece of clothing , took several happy turns about the yard , then glided back to her lines to hang a garment . The mule made no sound but plunged wildly in the harness . Ostler leaned all his weight back on the lines . The wounded mule plunged again and again as the other mules responded to the lines . To cover his confusion at having let the sound escape him , he became very busy with the bait and floats and sinkers . He even baited up Helene 's line for her , and in a few moments their floats were bobbing on the waves . Far away upstream a new sound had begun a rumble-grumble like a big jet in the sky . We were lucky that Brains was a Scout Life Guard and knew how to heave a line . On the shore of this little eddy there is about two feet of gravel beach above the water . Standing on this beach , some of the men take the line of the little boat and let it drift down against another projecting angle . Here is a little shelf , on which a man from my boat climbs , and a shorter line is passed to him , and he fastens the boat to the side of the cliff . Then the second one is let down , bringing the line of the third . One miscalculation or false move could have knocked the H-bomb off the ledge into deeper water , possibly spilling its deadly contents out and poisoning the Mediterranean Sea over a vast area for many years . By means of a special Navy-developed underwater recovery apparatus , lifting lines were successfully attached to the H-bomb , bringing it undamaged to the surface . Another , the most famous of the charter fleets , is at Kailua-Kona , near the famous marlin grounds off the Kona coast . The skipper and crew pilot the boat , provide the gear , and bait the lines . But this leaves a man on the rock above , holding to the line of the little boat . When all is ready , he springs from the rock , clinging to the line with one hand , and swimming with the other , and we pull him in as he goes by . We run two or three rapids after they have been carefully examined . Then we have a series of six or eight , over which we are compelled to pass by letting the boats down with lines . All of the used clothing that arrives in Kabul from the States looks like new , if a little out of style . It is shipped after being dry-cleaned and pressed and then , when it gets to the bazaars , is hung on hangers on clothes lines stretched over the streets from store front to store front . Let 's have it ! said the warrant bosun to the shadowy men at his side ; and he did not say `` it `` ; he substituted a dirty noun for the pronoun , as unnecessarily as ever . He took the heaving line in his hands , deftly seized half a dozen coils in his right hand while his left loosely held the remainder , and whirled the weight with the full strength of his arm . The weight soared off into the darkness , and the line ran smoothly out from his left hand . Had it been daylight , the warrant bosun would have fired a line out of a gun , but in darkness that would mean a revealing flash . It was a silly thought . Sitting in a desk chair instead of paddling a canoe , pounding cursors instead of casting a line , and staring into a computer screen instead of peering into the silvery water of a still lake will never , for either Dan or me , replace the natural rhythms of real fishing . We had nothing to show for our long and agonizing voyage nothing at all except our lives . Gray clouds hung low in the sky when U-953 , once again old and rust bitten , fastened her lines at the quay . Got one ! Got one ! he cried , reeling in his line . They move there for an hour and wash clean and white . Fujima-san pulls in the line . A whole worm looked huge in comparison . A sharp tug at his line made him straighten up suddenly . `` Hey , I got a fish , `` he shouted , jerking the line through the water . And then suddenly there was no weight on the end of the line .. But the only hope for the women and children was the launch . A boat carrying a line was hurled into the cove at the cost of one broken arm . Victoria 's nails scored his back . Igor retreated from the cave , paying out the line as he went . Then while I sat at the table and drank orange juice and poured milk over cornflakes , she would talk to me about all the things she 'd already done that day . `` Why , I 've got a load of wash on the line and some ironing done . For minutes it was like a slapstick comedy . We 'd jump ; we 'd swing out to the ends of our lines as if we were flying . It reached far out into the Bay of Kiel . At that long jetty , many a British warship had fastened her lines for a friendly visit during the internationally famous `` Kieler Week `` of the Kaiser 's era . Freddy reached into the box and brought out a small fishing rod in three sections . He fitted two of them together , strung the line along its length , and then , dropping the whole apparatus through the open pane , extended it over the next tank and lowered the hooks . It was like an open stone quarry , cushioned with sponge . We stopped at the outer limits of our lines . Hugh Woolner shouted as 14 sailed up . Lowe tossed over a line and gave them a tow . But between the two of us we somehow got it launched , then loaded it with blankets , clean diapers and the last of the milk . I sat down in the bow holding the baby , while Sidney untied the line and pushed us out into the current with a paddle . The fishermen ran back with him to Boris . Many hands grabbed the line from the panting cook . Human muscle and skill had to take the place of a gun , and if the line were badly thrown , if it fell short and had to be recoiled and re-thrown , five minutes would be wasted , and , with many ships to fuel , a similar mistake at each would make a total of many minutes lost , and in so many minutes ... The warrant bosun did not know that Nelson had once said that at sea five minutes can make the difference between victory and defeat , but he felt that truth in his bones after twenty years in the Navy . The weight shot off into the darkness , trailing the line behind it , and the warrant bosun uttered a grunt of morose satisfaction at feeling the line catch and hold . And I wondered if it made it harder for Ruby to grow up with a long neck and bony arms and freckles , after she 'd dreamed about being rich and glamorous . I went around to the back of the house , and Aunt Lou was coming in from the yard with her clothes basket full of clothes taken down from the line . He could feel the cage move as it strained against the lashings at each roll . What he could not see was how the constant working of the cage was wearing the line thin where it was tied to the railing . A big sea , a heavy roll , and the line finally parted . With the next roll the cage slid a foot , then was stopped by the slackening line . On the following roll the cage slid back a foot and Ben 's great weight behind it shot the cage forward and snapped the remaining lines . Time 2120 , August 22 , 1944 . Only a few seamen were on deck to handle the lines . She is in swift water , and they are not able to pull her back ; nor are they able to go on with the line , as it is not long enough to reach the higher part of the cliff , which is just before them ; so they take a bight around a crag . I send two men back for the other line . When the time came to launch , we were able to paddle into a flat ocean between wave sets . Then our little fleet reassembled offshore near a kelp bed , where we learned to hook the bow lines of our boats to the living kelp You take your anchors where you find them in this life . If it 's all that important , I 'll come . `` They went to the shed where Liscom kept his line and pulleys , and then , spaced about twenty yards apart so as not to attract attention , they made their way to Jules Lenihan 's house . Lynn took her place on the ledge and dropped her hand through the opening . With the rod extended over the tank , she lowered the line into the middle of the circling shapes . A stay ran to the bow , but none to the stern . Instead , a series of harp-like lines were secured from the top of the mast to the sides of the craft , extending about two thirds of the way back . And here they were , nearing the breakwater , and the civilian pilot was coming on board to lay them alongside the finger pier , bright in the blazing lights which revealed all the feverish activity of the yard . The lines were hardly secured before a dozen men were ready to come on board naval officers and civilians in approximately equal numbers . As before , we drifted down upon it . Tackles were made fast and lines flung to the men , who scrambled aboard like monkeys . The brute fought for a moment until the water foamed about its tail . The line snapped , and the shark disappeared into the depths . Then he was carried aft and flung into the sea . Forty fifty sixty feet of line ran out , when Wolf Larsen cried `` Belay ! `` The month of August in ' 41 was but a few days old when U-557 sailed for her second patrol . At 1400 we removed the lines from the pillars . My thoughts do n't fire at rocket speed . I stood there ; I counted the lines twice before the first pang of panic went through me . Betty continued to accelerate on her runaway course . Then , towed behind her at the end of the safety line , appeared a spacesuit . He said he did n't know ; they had come there in a wagon . I pulled in my line and went up the bank . Nevertheless , she had no way of asking him why he was n't wearing them . Lines had been stretched between the limbs of the four great pasania trees by the kitchen , and wash now took up every inch of the linen cords that webbed the trees together . Maggie , tied beneath the lines , kept running back and forth under the white shapes sportively flapping over her head and every once in a while let out a prolonged howl . When the wash was hung , Etsuko walked around between the lines . The application of pressure in matters of this kind requires a certain delicacy of touch and a measure of patience . It is like an angler who has only a light line to land a large fish . In a few minutes he , too , is kicking in the creel . I sit in happy meditation on my rock , pondering , while my line dries again , upon the ways of trout and men . The ship backs off with a clang of bells . A nylon line stretches taut to the whale , dripping along its length and trembling like a fiddle string . Then he was stopped abruptly a third time . The hunter gave the line an angry jerk only to be pulled savagely backwards onto the seat of his sealskin pants . About three years ago , he nearly gave up because he had nothing to sell . Now his shelves are full , and towels and clothes hang from a line overhead . Doc ... Calling Doc ... Are you there on the fourth ? ... Calling Doc ... No answer . I touched the wind-up button , the spool turned , and the fourth line came reeling in . That was enough distance in this thick air to walk out of sight of each other , as we soon discovered . These lines , not chain but light , tough rope , too strong to be broken , were all one needed to be sure he would not float off in space when he stepped or jumped . There is nothing like the used clothing bazaar in Kabul on a windy November day . Etched against the bleak , drab sky are sweaters , suits , and long underwear that dance merrily in the breeze on myriad lines high above your head . Once or twice I thought the first drops had begun to fall . I rushed downstairs to bring the washing in from the line . Now and then Ra heeled so violently that everyone gripped the stays and hung outboard as a counterweight . The duck was washed overboard on its line time after time , and in the worst of the chaos it broke a leg , which Yuri later had to set . Later I spoke to Georges , pointing out that on this voyage no one was obliged to clean up after anyone else . Shortly afterward Georges ' fishing tackle , tape recorder and dirty clothes had been picked off the deck and cabin roof , and he and Carlo began hauling on the same line together . Not only that , but the midget sub was about to pull the motor launch down , too . `` Cut the line ! `` Will he be first ? Will the line foul his propellers or break his rudder ? Give it a prolonged blow . Proudly , I give the green line a tug . A few seasons ago , he fell into the water wrestling with a large catch . He hung on to his line -- and landed the fish . Their task of keeping the bow into the seas had been eased by the sea anchor , but they must still be alert for every plunging movement of the ship . Merewether took a turn of line about himself and fastened it to the weather shrouds . There 's none there . He hurried outside to see if there were any dry ones on the line . If you see blue sky through more than one panel , pull your reserve ... . Start preparing your landing immediately . Watch for smoke or flags to see how the wind is blowing on the ground ... . Put your arms up on the shroud lines and grab a handful . Trigano grasped it and tied it securely around his bundles . Then he tugged twice on the line . The Yard Families fortunate enough to have yard space are no doubt already using it for soft ball , pitching practice , touch football , and the like . Badminton is a great family game , and a clothes line may be used for a net in a pinch . All animal life was new and full of wonder for Jim as much as for Chet , and he longed to see a fish , to touch its scaly sides , to examine its gills . But when ten minutes had passed without a nibble on Chet 's line , Jim started to give up hope . After more than three hours in the water , Brown was picked up . As he reached for the line thrown from the Warrington he was feebly shouting , `` I had eighteen men . The whale is no less astounded than the boy . The line speeds from the bucket like a living thing . On the deck of the Winslow , Ensign Worth Bagley stood ready to catch it . Before the line could be cast , a shell struck the Winslow , instantly killing Bagley and three torpedo men . Despite the enemy fire , which now seemed to be entirely concentrated on the two struggling ships , the line was thrown . I mean it could have happened ! Just as he unfastened himself , he might have seen Doc coming along , with a hand on the line . phone Inside a dark tent , Kayitan Kavas , a county commissioner , shouts into a telephone for more help . On the other end of the line , a voice promises 8,400 more blankets . \""

       "'In one , the \" Emma Dean \" is caught in a whirlpool , and set spinning about ; and it is with great difficulty we are able to get out of it , with the loss of an oar . At noon , another is made ; and on we go , running some of the rapids , letting down with lines past others , and making two short portages . He was investigating a routine complaint , he said , but we were in the clear as far as he was concerned ; Jack was a fine healthy donkey . He asked about exercise , and we showed him the exercise line . It was true that there were no spikes in papyrus boats . Instead , a block of wood was made fast with rope on top of the reed bundles , and the mast was stepped into it and secured with lines . Who ever would have guessed , when they made fast to the shore , that in ten minutes the diving suit would be called for in such a frantic hurry ? The air pump whispered steadily in his ear as he trailed pipe and lines behind him . On certain days the waves weren\\'t big enough to make much difference , but at other times they were mountainous , and he would arrive home soaked to the skin and aching in every muscle . But he loved it , and he never got over the thrill of feeling the sudden tug when a fish hit his line . However , let it be understood that no one should dive without some type of personal float , such as an inflatable vest , in addition to a surface float . A good automobile inner tube with attached line makes a very effective and practical surface float for resting . Held in this way , the men are able to pull her into a cove , in the left wall , where she is made fast . But this leaves a man on the rock above , holding to the line of the little boat . They were soon becalmed and were waiting for help when a fishing boat appeared . Without a word the skipper threw the girls a line and began to tow them to shore . Sheer chance has led him east . He passes by the trailing lines of fishermen from Neah Bay and Sekiu and Pysht . To us who are below , it seems impossible to keep the boat from going under the overhanging cliff ; but Powell , for the moment , heedless of Bradley\\'s mishap , pulls with all his power for half a dozen strokes , when the danger is past ; then he seizes Bradley , and pulls him in . The men in the boat above , seeing this , land , and she is let down by lines . The combatants glaze their kite lines with a mixture of paste and ground glass , then take their positions with highly maneuverable kites . Lines cross , overlap . The company argued that its foreman needn\\'t have told the worker not to move the plank to which his lifeline was tied because \"that comes with common sense.\" The commission noted, however, that Dellovade hadn\\'t instructed its employees on how to secure their lifelines and didn\\'t heed a federal inspector\\'s earlier suggestion that the company install special safety lines inside the A-frame structure it was building. Top loading automatic washer with essential cycle and temperature controls , soap or detergent , bleach , water softener , starch , laundry . Discuss types of machine dryers , clothes lines , clothes pins , clothes pin bags , clothes line supports ; types of fabrics and colors , line space available , and weather conditions . Wet laundry in clothes basket , clothes line , clothes pins , clothes pin bag . When wash is dry , remove from line , article by article , placing pins in bag . But he is in a whirlpool . We have the stem-post of his boat attached to the line . There was a two-inch messenger line attached to the heaving line the warrant bosun was responsible for the vital knot which joined them and , by the time the two-inch line was being hauled into the battleship , the warrant bosun was ready to follow it with a 3-1/2-inch line , and that was followed by a five-inch line , and that was strong enough to have entrusted to it the immense Manila towline on which the rest of the operation depended . From other parts of the ship , other heaving lines had been thrown , other messengers passed , now that the two ships were riding together more or less comfortably harnessed together with the heavy Manila . I\\'d seen it work once on a large hunting dog . With assorted children in attendance , I led the donkey to the line . Then Chris , who was ten , snapped the catch onto the exercise line . A bucket at his side was overflowing with pollack . He hauled the line in , baited it carefully with a piece of bacon , and lobbed it back into the sea with a splash .  Hold the rod ,  Freddy repeated grimly ; he began sawing on the line with his penknife ; the shark was twisting at the end , swinging back and forth like a pendulum . As Freddy slashed through the line , Lynn and George toppled over backward , and the shark , as amazed as any of them , dropped with a towering splash into the piranha tank .  Maybe you\\'ve caught a whale !  The shining line came up out of the water .  Help me play it , you fool . It\\'ll break the line .\\nphone\\tBut with the city\\'s growth as the West Coast\\'s financial hub and the gateway to the Pacific Rim, businessmen with expense accounts have clamored for first-class hotel rooms. Guests, who typically shell out $175 to $300 a night for a single (the price can go up to $3,000 for the ne plus ultra in sybaritic surroundings), are being pampered with larger rooms or suites, real marble bathrooms with television, phones with more than one line, plush robes, exotic flowers and complimentary wine.\\nphone\\tAnalysts said the two-year contract probably makes the Swedish telecommunications group the leading supplier of telecommunications equipment to China. Ericsson already has installed or taken orders for about 442,000 lines in China, and has a few smaller orders to supply switching equipment.\\nphone\\tThe only reason the former employees reportedly gave for tapping the phones was for national security concerns. Three of the residents, whose lines were allegedly tapped, filed the suits.\\nphone\\tIn Atlanta, John L. Clendenin, BellSouth\\'s chairman and chief executive, said the results reflect strong growth in both our telephone operating companies and our non-regulated subsidiaries.\" While also providing no details of the unregulated businesses, he said BellSouth telephone company units added a record 177,000 new access lines. I add my own non-expert suggestion Keep your eyes on the kite . The line may break ( mine has ) .  He followed the fourth one out of sight .

Tandy introduced two additions to the low end of its line, aimed at two markets that are Tandy\\'s traditional strength, schools and home users.\\ndivision\\tSuch foggy rhetoric reflects a 30-year-long weakening of the Democratic and Republican parties. They have fewer and fewer strong adherents divided by clear lines of traditional left-right ideology.\\nproduct\\tWhat\\'s more, investors for the Bass group, who raised their Macmillan stake to 9% earlier this year, appear to show particular interest in publishing. But some of Bell & Howell\\'s lines could be a difficult fit if the publishing companies were combined.\\nproduct\\tAt Pittsburgh\\'s ASP Inc., which introduced its first anti-virus software in 1985, We shipped out 80 copies (at $35 each) last week,\" says founder Fred Cohen, who presented the first computer virus to the research community in 1983. After adding Certus, a $189 anti-virus computer program, to its line of systems management software in early 1988, Foundation Ware Inc., Cleveland, has quadrupled sales every quarter, says founder Peter Tippett. What do you want me to do ? \" broke in Eugene eagerly , interrupting Vautrin . \" Almost nothing at all , \" rejoined he , allowing a movement of joy to escape him , inexorable as the expression of the angler who feels a fish at the end of his line . \"  It\\'s all right ,  he said . On Parker Street the buildings seemed to be dwellings , to judge from the lines of wash near them . He was wet and hungry and weary but the Fleet oiler was moving up alongside the carrier , and the warrant bosun had to leave off swearing . Those messenger lines had to be passed , and he could save five minutes if he made quite sure that they went over at the first attempt . Modern echo sounders are so sensitive they can detect shipwrecks and schools of fish . The equipment replaces the older technique of throwing a weighted line into the sea . Then we go , gliding by hills and ledges , with distant walls in view ; sweeping past sharp angles of rock ; stopping at a few points to examine rapids , which we find can be run , until we have made another five miles , when we land for dinner . Then we let down with lines , over a long rapid , and start again . The Saratoga came next , followed by the Ticonderoga and the Preble . Mobility had been provided for by attaching spring lines to the anchor cables , one on each side the ships could be moved in position by hauling in on one line , while paying out on the other .  The kedge went down nearly a mile from the ship . Men fell to on the capstan , winding in the line .\\nphone\\tA spokesman for the NSA declined to comment on the agency\\'s role in the Iran-Contra affair. Intelligence sources said the encryption devices, described as computer-type keyboards that are connected to ordinary telephone lines, aren\\'t the most sophisticated such machines developed by the NSA.\\nproduct\\tEarnings for the quarter were on target, analysts said. All segments of their business were up in sales, and they had an especially strong gain in their prescription line,\" said PaineWebber\\'s Mr. Nordmann. Looking down , Jeremy saw the water turning pink below his neck . As the throbbing pain in his temple increased , he knew it was too far to shore and too far to reach for a handhold on one of the boats\\' anchor lines . Thus taken between the two vessels , U-415 began her slow march into port . 0445 Maneuvering with difficulty on our one lame diesel , I aimed my ship toward the illuminated square in the bunker , where I saw a few black figures waiting on the pier . The bow bounced off the concrete head wall , but the lines , already fastened at the pillars on land , held the boat steady . With cat-like care not to roil his majesty\\'s bath , I step in , and stand stock-still for five minutes to let things calm down . The while , I strip out , oil , dry , and coil upon my left hand thirty feet of line . The singletree on the off side dragged and bounced against the front wheel . The lines in the Professor\\'s hands drooped down onto the tongue and neck yoke . She waited while her host removed a dismantled speaker assembly on his single upholstered chair and flicked the cushion in a grand manner with his pocket handkerchief . She took the hand he offered to aid her cakewalk to the chair over the coiled lines . Ready now ! Coil up the dry line and stand midstream , rod in instant readiness .  But it was a little longer than that , though at last they were there a farm and its farmyard , lightless . The stranger stopped the horse and handed Picklock the lines .\\nproduct\\tA good example is its July purchase of Cessna Fluid Power division from General Dynamics Corp. The unit, with annual sales of about $100 million, fills out Eaton\\'s hydraulics products line and provides an entry into Europe\\'s hydraulics business.\\nproduct\\tUpriver, men demonstrate the business end of a blowgun.

The engines in both those lines are 1.6 liter.\\ncord\\tA second aquanaut , pretending to be lost , would then signal the porpoise by turning on his own buzzer . After Tuffy reached the  victim , \" the aquanaut would remove the line from Tuffy\\'s harness and use it as his guide back to the habitat . Even so , the sheer clutter in that basement took a bit of sorting out , especially in that dim light . One wall had a floor-to-ceiling spread of wall-bars on gymnasium lines . Without the shelter of the small boat harbor , they were pitifully vulnerable to the gale that drove into the bay from the open sea . Unless they had stout anchor lines and plenty of scope , they would be in trouble . The Professor imagined that he was far above them , so that he could see men and their unknown ends as men can see longhorns and the ends they cannot see . He saw the remuda and the cowboys ; then he saw a wagon jolting along and himself holding drooping lines , sitting looking at the back ends of four mules . He cannot contain his excitement . He grabs a shark iron , a keen-edged harpoon with line and float attached , and seconds later hurls it deep into the back of a small female that slides beneath him . Your father was never fond of fishing , so he didn\\'t stock the lake . When I was a youngster I was used to waste hours hopefully casting a line on to it , until my uncle gently broke it to me that there were no trout in it . We could hear voices and shouted orders . At length , a signal was given and men started pulling on the line which ran through the block at the peak of the tripod . Early on the third day after our encounter with the British cruisers , we found the lonely Belchen at the designated place . Approaching slowly , we identified ourselves , exchanged courtesies through the megaphone , and caught the line to which the oil hose was fastened . As he came alongside , a hatchway opened in the side of the ship above him . A line was played down to the rowboat . The lifeless body rolls in a pink wash . They haul her partly out of the sea with the ship\\'s tackle and a line looped round her flukes .  The two men hauled on the fish . It dragged yards of line into the water , but they gradually drew it back .\\nproduct\\tThe company also owns such major liquor brands as Jim Beam, Old GrandDad and Old Crow. Other lines include Swingline office products, Case cutlery, Titleist and Foot-Joy golf items and Master Locks.\\nproduct\\tSales rose 16% to $1.4 billion from $1.21 billion.

Emhart, a maker of industrial, consumer and electronic goods, said Price Pfister\\'s residential-plumbing line would complement Emhart\\'s construction and do-it-yourself products.\\ntext\\tThere is a Dadaist nonsense letter entitled The,\" in which that word has been replaced by an asterisk. Thus, the epistle\\'s opening line reads \"If you come into linen, your time is thirsty because ink saw some wood intelligent enough to get business from a sister.\"  Whoa !  George cried , and pulled on the lines so hard that he sat down almost on top of his father\\'s head . Fastened securely to the pin is a barbless hook similar to a fisherman\\'s gaff . Throwing the pin-like float , with rawhide line attached , over and beyond the dead animal , the hunter drags it back across his prize , snagging it with the sharp hook . In March it is wise to clean cupboards , and cabinets . The closets need a good airing and all the clothes need to be hung on the line in the backyard . Now , if someone was to cut the arm of that hoist almost through , then the first time Doc got a good heavy dredge-load outa the water the arm\\'d most likely break , and the whole thing\\'d go straight to the bottom . Might even take Doc with it , if he got fouled up in the line . They can, however, be summed up simply Never think of your limits or distant goals; keep telling yourself to go just a little farther. If the Daedalus pilot does run out of steam, though, he can toss a line to a chase boat, which in theory will be able to keep the aircraft aloft by pulling it to shore like a giant kite. The one Lynn had hooked measured about two feet in length ; George saw that they could never get it up even if they had wanted to . \" Hold the rod , \" Freddy repeated grimly ; he began sawing on the line with his penknife ; the shark was twisting at the end , swinging back and forth like a pendulum . It is with no little misgiving that we see the river enter these black , hard walls . At its very entrance we have to make a portage ; then we have to let down with lines past some ugly rocks . Both full stop . Fasten all lines . Soon a detachment of sailors gathered at the base of the lighthouse to work out a way to get Thompson down . Homemade kites with lines attached were flown up in the air . For tedious seconds nothing happened . Then there was a series of sharp bangs as some of the tow lines parted . It might even be expressed more forcibly still The admiral at the battleship\\'s bridge , the admiral with the broad gold on his sleeve , irascibly signalling \" Expedite , \" was at that particular moment a less important person than the warrant bosun , wet through , worn out , and yet still swinging out the boom and hose with all the accurate judgement of twenty years of experience . The work had begun before daylight ; and night was about to fall when the last line was cast off and faked down . We spend the whole day on the water . Pascal fishes with a line that has a number of hooks on it . The eldest boy had got over his seasickness , and he and the middle one sat in numbed silence in the stern . When they reached the dock , Bubba made the lines fast and then helped the woman out of the boat . I blow upon my fly to give it one last fluff , lay it on the stream at my feet , and quickly pay out coil after coil . Then , just as the line straightens out and the fly is sucked into the jungle , I walk quickly downstream , straining my eyes into the dark vault to follow its fortunes . How satisfying it was to be expected , how good it was to have survived ! A military band launched into a resounding march as U-557 came alongside the quay and fastened her lines .  The tank Lynn was referring to was in the deepest of the shadows , but they could all make out several shapes moving to and fro in the turgid waters .  One more it is , \" agreed Sally , and she turned the line over to Lynn . Some families rig old automobile batteries to an underwater light . The fish , attracted by the light , bite the pieces of raw shrimp bait on the hooks dangling from the lines of the fishing poles . May 31 . We start down another canyon , and reach rapids made dangerous by high rocks lying in the channel ; so we run ashore , and let our boats down with lines . Ranging too far from an underwater habitat can be dangerous because the diver may not be able to find his way back . To prevent any such incident during the Sealab experiment the aquanauts were attached to their dwelling by guide lines whenever they swam for any distance . Mr. Coate was on the water but a few minutes when he said, \"Here they are . . . let\\'s catch some of \\'em.\" Lines were lowered and soon one of the rods sprang to life, and a shiny bronze walleye was swung on board. My wrists and arms ached intolerably , and though I had eaten heartily of a twelve o\\'clock lunch , I had worked so hard that I was faint from hunger . I pulled in the oars and bent forward to the line which held the tow . Meanwhile , the Fairy moves in under full power and two sailors carry rifles up to the peak . They blaze away at the running whale for an hour and are about to quit from exhaustion when they see the line go slack . Come here and give me a hand . \" While the two detectives were chatting , the skipper on his own initiative had baited a line and apparently hooked a massive fish . Many hands grabbed the line from the panting cook . His palms were slashed and bleeding where the line had burned deep furrows in them . We passed some crumbling houses on the left . The clothes on the line were flying in the wind . But if anything happened to you , they could use you for seed . \" The Soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly together , also lashing them to the body of the Saw-Horse ; so there seemed little danger of their tumbling off . \" The only sound was a wailing baby somewhere in the boat . Lines were dropped , and now the boat was fast . When she was not helping her mother make bread , or sliding pots of bubbling brown beans in or out of the big oven at the side , or basting great joints of meat , she was on her knees scrubbing the wooden floors , their planks worn smooth by the steady tattoo of many feet and by sanding and scouring . Or she was washing the big tubful of clothes that accumulated so quickly , hanging them out to dry on a line that reached all the way across the clearing behind the house . Each child crayons a design on his or hers , after he has printed his name in big letters . The cardboards are stapled to a long , strong line , which then can be looped around the room , or between posts or trees , or along a fence . When Albert Cluveau said that about Ned my heart started beating so fast I thought I might fall . I held on tight to the fishing pole till I was steady , then I pulled in my line and went back home . I well remember a particular incident I came upon the two older boys fishing in the late evening at the side of the pond . Two grown men were rigged like wireless stations with every imaginable kind of fish line and fish lure , having fun for themselves . The men were to swim down to the hole in the hull and push the corks through it so they would bob to the surface inside the ship . There , other men would grasp the lines attached to the corks . We looked more like undernourished and fatigued jungle fighters . Our lines were thrown ashore . No one had the heart to kill it , however , so it was spared and christened Sinbad . With a line tied to its foot , it became master of the foredeck , while Safi kept to the cabin area . He was playing his own game of hide-and-seek , enjoying the protective coloration of his space suit . Dillo touched one of the buttons at the platform , and the spool for the fourth hitch reeled in the line slowly .  Well , no , Sam ,  Alice said kindly , \" it is really time for us to go anyway . Perhaps next time we come , you will put a fence round the washing line . Then Pete heard Ron\\'s voice . He pulled in his line and put his pole between the rocks where the wind couldn\\'t reach it . Flag-line fishermen cruise offshore , putting out lines that are from five to eight miles long . These long lines are set at intervals with baited hooks marked by floats and buoys . Jim ran to his father , who was studying the ice near the edge of the water , and called , \" Ted\\'s got London on the radio , Dad ! \" They gathered around all but Chet , who went on dangling his line stolidly as though the entire success of their journey depended on his luck as a fisherman . They haul on the line to bring the boat in , but the power of the current , striking obliquely against her , shoots her out into the middle of the river . The men have their hands burned with the friction of the passing line ; the boat breaks away , and speeds , with great velocity , down the stream . We can climb it , and walk along its summit to a point where we are just at the head of the fall . Here the basalt is broken down again , so it seems to us , and I direct the men to take a line to the top of the cliff , and let the boats down along the wall . One man remains in the boat , to keep her clear of the rocks , and prevent her line from being caught on the projecting angles . Mrs. Smith was standing looking out of the windows , which opened on the water . In the distance a pair of white sailboats were skimming along on the breeze , and closer at hand a water skier was weaving in an intricate pattern at the end of a line attached to a motorboat . It was a mackerel , about 12 inches long . I threw my line out and landed a small sea bass . A wide stream up which launches and small ships moved back and forth ? Where people on this hot Saturday morning would be drifting idly in little boats , trailing lines in the water , fishing the sandy bottom ? There are grown macho men who can skin game but who won\\'t touch an eelpout, says Jeffrey Gunderson, a representative of the University of Minnesota\\'s Sea Grant Extension program, which tries to promote underused fish. \"They\\'ll cut their lines rather than bring it into the boat and unhook it.\"  We\\'ll bring the Bristol in ,  he called , indicating a motorboat swaying on its moorings . Dick waved that he understood , then lowered his water skis to the sand and started to uncoil a tangled line , tossing an end to Alan Carlisle . Behind our house in the laundry , Mary and Tessie spent their Mondays on two sides of a big ironing table , passing over the sheets an iron heated by a little coal stove . Outside the laundry in a small mosquitoey backyard , bathing suits hung eternally on the line ; there was a big coal bin by the fence . As the two Hindus took in the sail , the old man used the last of the boat\\'s way to lay alongside the starboard gangway . Jackson , boatswain\\'s mate of the watch , took a line , and shouted for side boys . A thin and broad-shouldered young man named Pylor , from the island of Kea , said that he had much diving experience after the sponges that grew offshore there , and he volunteered to look under the galley . A line was tied under his arms and he dived and came up quite soon after . He introduced his children to the sport as toddlers, and wasn\\'t about to take no for an answer. When Camille balked at taking the line at age four, she was left to ponder her choice in the middle of a lake. Kuktoy had lived on the island all of his life and had weathered more trials than I\\'d ever heard about . As a young man , Kuktoy had three of his fingers ripped out of their sockets by getting them fouled in a rawhide harpoon line and had doctored them himself . Saturday morning she ran the sweeper and in the afternoon she bought groceries . Monday after work she washed the navy blue and white Orlon dress she wore Sunday to the movies and hung it on the rope line above the bathtub . The strain had been too great . Somewhere along the line the strands were parting , and at any minute the cable might snap completely . Any hungry shark following will come after the fish , not the diver . The length of the line protects a diver by giving him time to see an approaching shark and swim away . Dillo was shouting . \" Who let the chimp off the line ? \" When he pulled up the hook , it was picked clean . He stood watching it swing slowly back and forth on the end of his line . I found a light kedge anchor in the fore hold , where such things were kept , and with a deal of exertion got it on deck and into the boat . With a long running line coiled down in the stern , I rowed well out into our little cove and dropped the anchor into the water . So the men made their own . Men forged hooks and filched nylon lines from aerial kites and weather balloons . Sally , Freddy , Lynn , and George scrambled back across the branch , down to the earth , and out of the museum grounds as fast as they could . \" I hope the line disappears in the fight , \" Freddy said as he replaced the ladder in the little equipment shed from which he had borrowed it . He stood a few yards away , to one side of the entrance . Then he jerked the line , suddenly , and clasped his hands over his ears .  Tall mulatto in the white cowboy hat said  \\' Nough of this . Langlois , fetch two plow lines off that wagon . \" Sappho said he was running before the tall mulatto mentioned the plow lines , he just started running faster when he heard it . At the best of the local hotels, the door was already locked at 7:30 in the evening. After several rings, the proprietor reluctantly showed his guest to a rooftop cell with concrete walls and floor, a pile of flea-ridden mattresses, no sheets, two naked bulbs, and a laundry line strung with damp clothes. The crew strolled aboard in small groups , as inconspicuously as possible , so as not to suggest to the French dockhands of the night shift that we might be sailing . At midnight we removed the lines from the pillars .  Catch anything ?  the leader asked . \" Just one , \" Drew answered , pointing to the fish he had tied up on a line floating in the water .  You came here to fish ,  said Galkin . \" Put your line in the water , then sit down and tell me all about yourself . \" Pass it forward , get it under the bows and astern . \" Men struggled to position the heavy line ; once more the capstan clanked its turns . The boom leans perilously over the side ; the deck slants ; a bucket bangs against the rail . Now a man jerks a slender trip-wire following the line from deck to whale . Although these people live in Big Sky Country -- Montana, where a town can have a name that rings with heroic confidence, Great Falls, Sunburst, Victory -- they never achieve the baptism and resurrection that nature has so often promised characters in American fiction. They may fish and hunt a little, but they\\'re likely to feel sick about it, or bungle the job, or snag a dead deer that drowned in the river before they ever cast a line. He made him the gardener of the Kingdom , to drive away the sparrows from the King\\'s head . 48 . Old Hiram\\'s goat was feeling fine , ate three red shirts right off the line . Then we let down another boat to the end of its line beyond the first , and the third boat to the end of its line below the second , which brings it to the head of the fall , and under an overhanging rock . Then the upper boat , in obedience to a signal , lets go ; we pull in the line , and catch the nearest boat as it comes , and then the last . Jack Clements slowed the engine to make his dock approach . The change of pace brought the others up , and Emil came into the pilothouse while the two crewmen went to bow and stern , ready to make the lines fast to the dock . The set, designed by Mr. Hall\\'s longtime associate Eugene Lee, has the audience divided in half, facing a central playing area. Off to one side -- representing the \"have-nots\" of Louisiana -- is a broken-down shack with a woodpile and a wash line. The instant an aku hit a hook , he was jerked into the canoe and flipped off . At once , the line and hook were back in the water and the free hand of the fisherman stirring the surface again . To my horror, I realize I have pulled too hard. Down comes the green line as the great whistle blares forth, a shrill torrent of sound that won\\'t stop.  Get down now ,  Cluveau said . Ned handed Bam the lines . At such a place , we are letting down the last boat , and , as she is set free , a wave turns her broadside down the stream , with the stem , to which the line is attached , from shore , and a little up . They haul on the line to bring the boat in , but the power of the current , striking obliquely against her , shoots her out into the middle of the river . The new technology represents a considerable savings over conventional offshore production technology. The foundation of the project, a \"tension-leg well platform,\" will be a floating structure that is anchored to the seabed by steel mooring lines, a design that requires far less steel than conventional platforms do. They never went where they could not ride . Thinking of the days of waiting on the riverbank , I wished I had provided him with hooks and a line . Dillo shouted . Gary had already jumped in straight pursuit and jumping , he swung his arm and threw a wave into the slack of his line . June 22 . Still making short portages and letting down with lines . The museum raises the best catfish for eating in the world . \" Freddy quickly brought up six or seven catfish , and then Sally took over the line . It was up to him to ease the strain or take it up , keeping the ships at a constant distance apart without allowing the towline to break under the continual jerks to which the waves subjected it . If that line should part , everything else , including the precious hoses which the booms were beginning to swing out over the gap , would be torn asunder . From a plastic bag in the box she chose a few slices of fish which had been taken from their remaining stock . She baited the hooks and turned the line over to Freddy . Spreading full-length on the edge of the skylight , Freddy lowered the line into a likely-looking tank directly underneath the open pane . The King had no success and was just about to abandon his efforts when Nell with a sprightly laugh urged him \" But see , Sire , you have got a bite at last . \" Sure enough , when the King pulled in his rod , he found half a dozen fried smelts at the end of the line , tied to his hook with a silken thread .  Yes , ma\\'am . I intend to ,  he said , almost insolently , backing toward the beds and uncoiling the line . \"  Cleat up ,  the Captain ordered . A deckman fastened the tow line to a cleat in the middle of the boat . The chamber was off the bottom . Waves were now running some five feet , so the men hauling in on the line went with the motion of Falcon , letting out a little whenever she rose , pulling in as she dipped . Second to the aku fishery in the islands\\' modern commercial fishing catch is the long-line or flag-line fishery . Flag-line fishermen cruise offshore , putting out lines that are from five to eight miles long . The Coast Guard was called about the dead dolphin . They came in a cutter and tied a line to its tail and began towing the body seaward . Did it fly ? Superbly with 200 rapt kite-fliers handling the lines . The red bra they\\'d all seen , and several others that the men hoped to see again filled . At first the men tried to avoid being caught looking at the line . I stand on a projecting rock , waving my hat to gain his attention , for my voice is drowned by the roaring of the falls . Just at this moment , I see him take his knife from its sheath , and step forward to cut the line . We found the house really has a board floor under all that dirt . We washed all the bedding , and it\\'s hanging on the line right now . She fought like a professional , holding the rod inside the skylight , while George added his weight to her pull . Freddy reached through the opening and grasped the line . Tipped off that Mr. Willaby is \"noodling\" -- catching fish illegally by snagging them in the gills or flesh -- two wildlife officials follow the 250-pound fisherman out to Cedar Creek Lake here. They watch him dive under water with a fishing pole and a very short line and catch two flathead catfish, one 25 pounds and the other 30 pounds. We land at its mouth , and stop for an hour or two to examine the fall . It seems possible to let down with lines , at least a part of the way , from point to point , along the right-hand wall . And the neighbours seemed to be very nice . One had been hanging clothes on her line while they were in the backyard and they had got to talking , and she had invited them in for a cup of tea . But he was understood in spite of the impolite waves and two crewmen carefully hooked a resplendent chromium ladder to the gunwales . Needing no urging , Dennis let go his hold of the parachute lines at the same instant that he stretched out his arms to grab the tubular sidepieces .  I\\'ll have the boats over to tow , if you please ,  the captain ordered . Boats dropped into the water , snaked out lines , and men bent to the oars . Later that night he scraped together as much debris as he could find in the cabin and tried to bury the untouched coon . Doc Painter had fastened a line to the water can and withdrew it the next morning , refilling it and slipping it back in again under the door . Neill felt his anger rising . The man was playing them , playing them like fish on a line . So , on this cool day in late March , I set to work . I engaged a cooperative clam digger for the use of his boat in helping me secure a line to the tail . The gunboat took its prize in tow , as the flagship signaled retirement for the small boats . The brigs and schooners advanced to get lines aboard their charges while the frigate , supporting with heavy fire , moved in toward the rocks through water that foamed with a hail of enemy projectiles . In this way , curious little alcoves are formed , in which are quiet bays of water , but on a much smaller scale than the great bays and buttresses of Marble Canyon . The river is still rapid , and we stop to let down with lines several times , but make greater progress as we run ten miles .  Courtships in the night are also intriguing . The male web-weaver spider woos the female in her web with a series of tugs and tweaks on her lines .\\nproduct\\tIn terms of speed, the new computers are expected to process from 2.7 million instructions per second, or MIPS, to more than 10 MIPS, depending on how many microprocessors are inside. In performance, they will overlap several IBM computers, including parts of the IBM 9370 line and the 4381 line.\\ncord\\tIn June, Hornby disclosed it had a 5.1% stake in Manitowoc and said it may seek control of the company. Manitowoc, a maker of cranes, power shovels, drag lines and other products, is based in Manitowoc, Wis.\\ntext\\tBlacks talk to their stars on the screen. If they hear a clever line, they\\'ll say, \\'Get down.\\' Not too young , I\\'d say . A new set of nappies suddenly appearing on the line would certainly set the neighbours chattering . Most divers in island waters carry a long line on which to string their catch . The end of this line is tied to an empty plastic bleach bottle , which serves as a buoy to keep the line floating so the diver can tow his catch a safe distance behind . There was no wind , the tide was high , and the schooner floated . Casting off the shore lines , I kedged her out by main strength , the windlass being broken , till she rode nearly up and down to the small anchor too small to hold her in any breeze . If he hadn\\'t it wouldn\\'t have reached us , because it was a heavy coil with a long way to go . I snubbed the line around the wagon seat , and made it good and tight with several half hitches . George could see , dimly against the water , the shadows of several fish warily circling their unexpected midnight snack . In a short while there was a tug on the line . In forests, their goal is to drape their chutes over the crown of a tree and slide down through the limbs on let-down ropes. But \"You never really know for sure what\\'s waiting for you,\" says John Driscoll, a former smokejumper who once landed flat on his back on the Alaskan tundra after his chute lines twisted and his reserve parachute wrapped around his neck. (Though he wasn\\'t hurt, \"I can still remember every second of it -- looking up to see the lines twisted and my parachute a worthless balloon over my head,\" he says.) This is not government-dictated planning, Mr. Webber says. \"It\\'s using government as a productive partner -- a catalyst -- instead of a drag on the line.\" They used dog bones to make small hooks , pig bones for the medium size , and human bones for large fish hooks . Hawaiian fishermen jigged with lines fitted with a stone sinker bound to a cowrie-shell lure to catch octopus . Burke\\'s calculations were slightly off . He had to start the engines again to get his plane close enough to throw a line to the raft .  Take a turn ,  he said quietly to the man . The boat puller obeyed , taking a turn around the little forward thwart and paying the line as it jerked taut .  Hull considered the suggestion a moment .  All right , Mr. Morris , have everything over five inches made up into a line , and send the launch and cutter ahead with a kedge anchor . The children are in a tree house high on the west hill . They have a perilously hung rope ladder which they tell me adults cannot climb . ( And I believe them , for the ropes are the old lines from our ancient catboat . ) Hand over hand they pulled in the silk . Then as the chute billowed over the small deck , Dennis leaned overboard to gather in the last few feet of the lines . This afternoon , we find three falls in close succession . We carry our rations over the rocks , and let our boats shoot over the falls , checking and bringing them to land with lines in the eddies below .  This time I\\'m doing it myself ,  said Ace . He climbed over into the cutter and untied the line . Miss Eustis has a somewhat different version \" One man was drunk and had a bottle of brandy in his pocket , which the Quartermaster promptly threw overboard , and the drunken man was thrown into the bottom of the boat ... \" There was a different kind of trouble in Boat 6 . Friction erupted from the moment Major Peuchen slid down the line to fill out the crew . He could see the crumpled form lying on the deck , spray driving into him , in danger of being washed over the side . Merewether tried to loosen the line that secured him to the shrouds and make his way forward to give assistance . Foolishness . Doc must have taken Percussie\\'s line . One bush , with its brown stem laved in the middle current , shook with a perpetual silent laughter , as if to mock at any fly that gods or men might cast one inch beyond its outermost leaf . For the duration of a cigarette I sit on a rock midstream and watch my trout rise under his guardian bush , while my rod and line hang drying on the alders of the sunny bank . Kite battles are fought daily from roofs and fields in Asia . The combatants glaze their kite lines with a mixture of paste and ground glass , then take their positions with highly maneuverable kites . Of course , you can\\'t keep an animal like that in a tiny pen all the time . He needed exercise , so we rigged up a line between two trees about 40 feet apart in the side yard . So he sells garlic. In one of his stalls in a back-alley market deep in Seoul\\'s south side he sells nothing but garlic Hundreds of straw \"chops\" or lines hang from the ceiling, each chop with 100 bulbs of garlic attached to it, each bulb containing five to 10 cloves. Furling the sail and lashing it securely about the mast , boom , sprit , and two pairs of spare oars , I threw it overboard . A line connected it with the bow , and as it floated low in the water , practically unexposed to the wind , it drifted less rapidly than the boat . Glassmaster Co., Lexington, S.C., started trading with the symbol GLMA. The company makes glass-fiber pleasure boats, monofilament lines and antennas. But things quickly became bleak again . We entered another dry period , and sharks carried away our lines before we could catch any more edible fish . The Saratoga moved again , completing her swing , inch by inch , with port guns firing as they bore . When it was observed aboard the Confiance that the American ship was swinging , a lieutenant had spring lines bent to his anchor cable in order to wind ship in similar fashion . The first step , after catching one , is to quickly turn the octopus inside out so that his sharp beaklike mouth has no chance to bite . Most divers in island waters carry a long line on which to string their catch . In an hour several dozen fish lay in the net on the bottom of the boat . \" That\\'s it , I think , \" the Professor said , reeling in his line . MANY LOBSTERS are alive and well and living in lost traps, say University of Maine researchers. During the past two years, the scientists have studied \"ghost lobster traps\" -- lost ones that sit on the ocean floor after lines to them are severed by storms, passing boats and other strains. Little knots of men swarmed over each boat , taking off the canvas covers , clearing the masts and useless paraphernalia , putting in lanterns and tins of biscuits . Other men stood at the davits , fitting in cranks and uncoiling the lines . I hoped they hadn\\'t come for dinner . It was going to be important for us to stay together , so I unwrapped the line from my waist , and we tied a length to each raft . But at the moment of contact Thomas Mugridge cried out . Then he came in like a fresh-caught fish on a line , clearing the rail generously and striking the deck in a heap , on hands and knees , and rolling over . But seriously folks, the Duvalls root heartily for each other on the water and are partners in a school for water-skiing-tournament aspirants in Windemere, Fla. Sammy won\\'t try a tricks competition unless Camille is there to supervise his tow line. At all other times they carefully avoid our hens , even to the point as has been often the case of walking right through a cluster of them , looking as smugly self-righteous as you could imagine . At other times , both dog fox and vixen have walked slowly under the clothesline as clothes were being hung , and blown flapping , and the wheel of the line connected with a tree was squeaking loudly . With a wild scream he dived into the shark-filled waters . But his partner had enough strength to drag him back and then to grab Burke\\'s line . There is much scratching of heads Who knows how to shoot a whale ? How big a line we need to hold him ? The Negro had the line and it was hard to tell who was pulling what , when LePeters saw Boners march to the rear of the boat , yank out a pistol , and with perfect aim drill two shots through the fish\\'s head . \" What the fuck\\'d you do that to the fish for ? \" said the skipper , holding a suddenly slack line . A two-pound bass on a fly-rod is more fun than a six-pounder on a bait-casting rod, said Mr. Kruger. \"Because the rod is so long and you hold the line directly in your fingers, you can feel every little fin vibration a bass makes.\" It was heard by ship brokers in Tokyo , and the stock of Matsushita broke half a point . Kasuo Fujima opens a roll of cloth in his kit and removes a length of cod line with triple hooks . I had held back the intestines to use for bait . Cherry weighted his line with a ring and dropped a hook overboard .  All right , you red lobsters , avast there ,  he bellowed . \" Throw your captain a line and help haul me aboard . Maybe next year they could rope the hay off the rack . Jesse stood up and took the lines from George . The team stopped abruptly . He made a half-hitch with the lines at the top of the hayrack\\'s middle upright , and turned to take his fork . Finding I am caught here , suspended 400 feet above the river , into which I should fall if my footing fails , I call for help . The men come , and pass me a line , but I cannot let go of the rock long enough to take hold of it . The stunts performed on the rope were the most interesting to me , however . The tightly stretched line served as a horizontal bar ; it had just enough spring to allow the contestants to combine their strength , nimbleness , and sense of timing into an astonishing array of acrobatic tricks . At the very moment when the man was apparently doomed to strike the hard edge of the apron and be dragged along its abrasive surface , the parachute tilted again , traded a share of downward motion for lateral slip , and drifted serenely over the grass . He struck and clutched at the lines while teetering , stumbled and rolled as the billowing canopy began to drag him heedlessly along the ground . It\\'s coming a little premonitory shiver in that aspen on the hill lets me get out half a cast , and swish it gently back and forth , ready for the main puff to hit the pool . No more than half a line , mind you !  Very good ,  said Galkin . He stood up and began reeling in his line . As she moved gracefully about on the glazed and frozen lawn , I realized that she was wearing ice skates ! I watched as she swooped down upon her clothes basket , extracted a piece of clothing , took several happy turns about the yard , then glided back to her lines to hang a garment . The mule made no sound but plunged wildly in the harness . Ostler leaned all his weight back on the lines . The wounded mule plunged again and again as the other mules responded to the lines . To cover his confusion at having let the sound escape him , he became very busy with the bait and floats and sinkers . He even baited up Helene\\'s line for her , and in a few moments their floats were bobbing on the waves . Far away upstream a new sound had begun a rumble-grumble like a big jet in the sky . We were lucky that Brains was a Scout Life Guard and knew how to heave a line . On the shore of this little eddy there is about two feet of gravel beach above the water . Standing on this beach , some of the men take the line of the little boat and let it drift down against another projecting angle . Here is a little shelf , on which a man from my boat climbs , and a shorter line is passed to him , and he fastens the boat to the side of the cliff . Then the second one is let down , bringing the line of the third . One miscalculation or false move could have knocked the H-bomb off the ledge into deeper water , possibly spilling its deadly contents out and poisoning the Mediterranean Sea over a vast area for many years . By means of a special Navy-developed underwater recovery apparatus , lifting lines were successfully attached to the H-bomb , bringing it undamaged to the surface . Another , the most famous of the charter fleets , is at Kailua-Kona , near the famous marlin grounds off the Kona coast . The skipper and crew pilot the boat , provide the gear , and bait the lines . But this leaves a man on the rock above , holding to the line of the little boat . When all is ready , he springs from the rock , clinging to the line with one hand , and swimming with the other , and we pull him in as he goes by . We run two or three rapids after they have been carefully examined . Then we have a series of six or eight , over which we are compelled to pass by letting the boats down with lines . All of the used clothing that arrives in Kabul from the States looks like new , if a little out of style . It is shipped after being dry-cleaned and pressed and then , when it gets to the bazaars , is hung on hangers on clothes lines stretched over the streets from store front to store front .  Let\\'s have it !  said the warrant bosun to the shadowy men at his side ; and he did not say \" it \" ; he substituted a dirty noun for the pronoun , as unnecessarily as ever . He took the heaving line in his hands , deftly seized half a dozen coils in his right hand while his left loosely held the remainder , and whirled the weight with the full strength of his arm . The weight soared off into the darkness , and the line ran smoothly out from his left hand . Had it been daylight , the warrant bosun would have fired a line out of a gun , but in darkness that would mean a revealing flash . It was a silly thought. Sitting in a desk chair instead of paddling a canoe, pounding cursors instead of casting a line, and staring into a computer screen instead of peering into the silvery water of a still lake will never, for either Dan or me, replace the natural rhythms of real fishing. We had nothing to show for our long and agonizing voyage nothing at all except our lives . Gray clouds hung low in the sky when U-953 , once again old and rust bitten , fastened her lines at the quay .  Got one ! Got one !  he cried , reeling in his line . They move there for an hour and wash clean and white . Fujima-san pulls in the line . A whole worm looked huge in comparison . A sharp tug at his line made him straighten up suddenly . \" Hey , I got a fish , \" he shouted , jerking the line through the water . And then suddenly there was no weight on the end of the line ..  But the only hope for the women and children was the launch .  A boat carrying a line was hurled into the cove at the cost of one broken arm . Victoria\\'s nails scored his back . Igor retreated from the cave , paying out the line as he went . Then while I sat at the table and drank orange juice and poured milk over cornflakes , she would talk to me about all the things she\\'d already done that day . \" Why , I\\'ve got a load of wash on the line and some ironing done . For minutes it was like a slapstick comedy . We\\'d jump ; we\\'d swing out to the ends of our lines as if we were flying . It reached far out into the Bay of Kiel . At that long jetty , many a British warship had fastened her lines for a friendly visit during the internationally famous \" Kieler Week \" of the Kaiser\\'s era . Freddy reached into the box and brought out a small fishing rod in three sections . He fitted two of them together , strung the line along its length , and then , dropping the whole apparatus through the open pane , extended it over the next tank and lowered the hooks . It was like an open stone quarry , cushioned with sponge . We stopped at the outer limits of our lines . Hugh Woolner shouted as 14 sailed up . Lowe tossed over a line and gave them a tow . But between the two of us we somehow got it launched , then loaded it with blankets , clean diapers and the last of the milk . I sat down in the bow holding the baby , while Sidney untied the line and pushed us out into the current with a paddle . The fishermen ran back with him to Boris . Many hands grabbed the line from the panting cook . Human muscle and skill had to take the place of a gun , and if the line were badly thrown , if it fell short and had to be recoiled and re-thrown , five minutes would be wasted , and , with many ships to fuel , a similar mistake at each would make a total of many minutes lost , and in so many minutes ... The warrant bosun did not know that Nelson had once said that at sea five minutes can make the difference between victory and defeat , but he felt that truth in his bones after twenty years in the Navy . The weight shot off into the darkness , trailing the line behind it , and the warrant bosun uttered a grunt of morose satisfaction at feeling the line catch and hold . And I wondered if it made it harder for Ruby to grow up with a long neck and bony arms and freckles , after she\\'d dreamed about being rich and glamorous . I went around to the back of the house , and Aunt Lou was coming in from the yard with her clothes basket full of clothes taken down from the line . He could feel the cage move as it strained against the lashings at each roll . What he could not see was how the constant working of the cage was wearing the line thin where it was tied to the railing . A big sea , a heavy roll , and the line finally parted . With the next roll the cage slid a foot , then was stopped by the slackening line . On the following roll the cage slid back a foot and Ben\\'s great weight behind it shot the cage forward and snapped the remaining lines . Time 2120 , August 22 , 1944 . Only a few seamen were on deck to handle the lines . She is in swift water , and they are not able to pull her back ; nor are they able to go on with the line , as it is not long enough to reach the higher part of the cliff , which is just before them ; so they take a bight around a crag . I send two men back for the other line . When the time came to launch, we were able to paddle into a flat ocean between wave sets. Then our little fleet reassembled offshore near a kelp bed, where we learned to hook the bow lines of our boats to the living kelp You take your anchors where you find them in this life. If it\\'s all that important , I\\'ll come . \" They went to the shed where Liscom kept his line and pulleys , and then , spaced about twenty yards apart so as not to attract attention , they made their way to Jules Lenihan\\'s house . Lynn took her place on the ledge and dropped her hand through the opening . With the rod extended over the tank , she lowered the line into the middle of the circling shapes . A stay ran to the bow , but none to the stern . Instead , a series of harp-like lines were secured from the top of the mast to the sides of the craft , extending about two thirds of the way back . And here they were , nearing the breakwater , and the civilian pilot was coming on board to lay them alongside the finger pier , bright in the blazing lights which revealed all the feverish activity of the yard . The lines were hardly secured before a dozen men were ready to come on board naval officers and civilians in approximately equal numbers . As before , we drifted down upon it . Tackles were made fast and lines flung to the men , who scrambled aboard like monkeys . The brute fought for a moment until the water foamed about its tail . The line snapped , and the shark disappeared into the depths . Then he was carried aft and flung into the sea . Forty fifty sixty feet of line ran out , when Wolf Larsen cried \" Belay ! \" The month of August in \\' 41 was but a few days old when U-557 sailed for her second patrol . At 1400 we removed the lines from the pillars . My thoughts don\\'t fire at rocket speed . I stood there ; I counted the lines twice before the first pang of panic went through me . Betty continued to accelerate on her runaway course . Then , towed behind her at the end of the safety line , appeared a spacesuit . He said he didn\\'t know ; they had come there in a wagon . I pulled in my line and went up the bank . Nevertheless , she had no way of asking him why he wasn\\'t wearing them . Lines had been stretched between the limbs of the four great pasania trees by the kitchen , and wash now took up every inch of the linen cords that webbed the trees together . Maggie , tied beneath the lines , kept running back and forth under the white shapes sportively flapping over her head and every once in a while let out a prolonged howl . When the wash was hung , Etsuko walked around between the lines . The application of pressure in matters of this kind requires a certain delicacy of touch and a measure of patience . It is like an angler who has only a light line to land a large fish . In a few minutes he , too , is kicking in the creel . I sit in happy meditation on my rock , pondering , while my line dries again , upon the ways of trout and men . The ship backs off with a clang of bells . A nylon line stretches taut to the whale , dripping along its length and trembling like a fiddle string . Then he was stopped abruptly a third time . The hunter gave the line an angry jerk only to be pulled savagely backwards onto the seat of his sealskin pants . About three years ago, he nearly gave up because he had nothing to sell. Now his shelves are full, and towels and clothes hang from a line overhead.  Doc ... Calling Doc ... Are you there on the fourth ? ... Calling Doc ...  No answer . I touched the wind-up button , the spool turned , and the fourth line came reeling in . That was enough distance in this thick air to walk out of sight of each other , as we soon discovered . These lines , not chain but light , tough rope , too strong to be broken , were all one needed to be sure he would not float off in space when he stepped or jumped . There is nothing like the used clothing bazaar in Kabul on a windy November day . Etched against the bleak , drab sky are sweaters , suits , and long underwear that dance merrily in the breeze on myriad lines high above your head . Once or twice I thought the first drops had begun to fall . I rushed downstairs to bring the washing in from the line . Now and then Ra heeled so violently that everyone gripped the stays and hung outboard as a counterweight . The duck was washed overboard on its line time after time , and in the worst of the chaos it broke a leg , which Yuri later had to set . Later I spoke to Georges , pointing out that on this voyage no one was obliged to clean up after anyone else . Shortly afterward Georges\\' fishing tackle , tape recorder and dirty clothes had been picked off the deck and cabin roof , and he and Carlo began hauling on the same line together . Not only that , but the midget sub was about to pull the motor launch down , too . \" Cut the line ! \" Will he be first ? Will the line foul his propellers or break his rudder ? Give it a prolonged blow. Proudly, I give the green line a tug. A few seasons ago, he fell into the water wrestling with a large catch. He hung on to his line -- and landed the fish. Their task of keeping the bow into the seas had been eased by the sea anchor , but they must still be alert for every plunging movement of the ship . Merewether took a turn of line about himself and fastened it to the weather shrouds .  There\\'s none there .  He hurried outside to see if there were any dry ones on the line . If you see blue sky through more than one panel , pull your reserve ... . Start preparing your landing immediately . Watch for smoke or flags to see how the wind is blowing on the ground ... . Put your arms up on the shroud lines and grab a handful . Trigano grasped it and tied it securely around his bundles . Then he tugged twice on the line . The Yard Families fortunate enough to have yard space are no doubt already using it for soft ball , pitching practice , touch football , and the like . Badminton is a great family game , and a clothes line may be used for a net in a pinch . All animal life was new and full of wonder for Jim as much as for Chet , and he longed to see a fish , to touch its scaly sides , to examine its gills . But when ten minutes had passed without a nibble on Chet\\'s line , Jim started to give up hope . After more than three hours in the water , Brown was picked up . As he reached for the line thrown from the Warrington he was feebly shouting , \" I had eighteen men . The whale is no less astounded than the boy . The line speeds from the bucket like a living thing . On the deck of the Winslow , Ensign Worth Bagley stood ready to catch it . Before the line could be cast , a shell struck the Winslow , instantly killing Bagley and three torpedo men . Despite the enemy fire , which now seemed to be entirely concentrated on the two struggling ships , the line was thrown .  I mean it could have happened ! Just as he unfastened himself , he might have seen Doc coming along , with a hand on the line .\\nphone\\tInside a dark tent, Kayitan Kavas, a county commissioner, shouts into a telephone for more help. On the other end of the line, a voice promises 8,400 more blankets.\\n '"
